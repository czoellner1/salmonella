		"abstract": "This paper examines the practical aspects of a concept for microbiological control of dressing operations on cattle slaughterlines. First, the spreading of Salmonella was examined. A total of 99 (3.66%) of the swab samples were positive. Cutting off the hooves and pre-skinning showed the highest recovery of Salmonella. A second survey included the detection of all the important groups of the surface microflora. The microbiological profiles of the carcasses were determined at the end of the slaughterline and after different stages of chilling. A consistently higher contamination was found satistically for the lateral surface of the carcasses and, within this area, the most contaminated sites were on the front quarter. The biometrical analysis revealed a significant interaction between contamination and site, and an indicator function of the total viable count (TVC) and the Enterobacteriaceae. The TVC (.hivin.x=4.95/s=0.34 cfu/cm2) indicated a farily good standard of slaughter hygiene. Correct chilling did not change the contamination rates very much. This increased contamination is a result of improper handling of the carcasses. The trends of both surveys demonstrate that, for cattle slaughter, the establishing of critical control points is a possible way for a plant to control the slaughterline.",

One hundred forty five samples consisting of whole chickens, chicken cuts and environmental samples were analysed for the presence of Salmonella. 133 (91.7%), 124 (85.5%) and 123 (84.8%) samples were positive by the culture-based method, 3M MDA and 3M Petrifilm SALX System, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy for the 3M MDA were 93.2, 91.7, 55.0, 99.2 and 93.1%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy for the 3M Petrifilm SALX System were 92.5, 100.0, 54.5, 100.0 and 93.1%, respectively. Both 3M MDA and 3M Petrifilm SALX System yielded similar kappa results, indicating substantial agreement with the culture-based method. The data from this study therefore supports the use of the 3M Petrifilm SALX System and the 3M MDA as rapid and reliable screening methods for Salmonella detection in poultry and its processing environment.

		"abstract": "Foodborne bacterial diseases are a serious challenge to human and animal health. Salmonella is a zoonotic foodborne pathogen and the etiologic agent of salmonellosis. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2016 to April 2016 on small scale and large scale dairy farms in and around Modjo town, Ethiopia. The main objectives of the study were to isolate and identify Salmonella from lactating cows, personnel's' and equipment at farms and to determine the in vitro antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates. A total of 266 samples consisting of fresh cow milk, fecal sample, pooled milkers' hand swab, pooled bucket swab, tank swab, and tank milk were collected from 21 dairy farms (n=20 smallholders, n=1 large scale farm). The samples were examined for the presence of Salmonella following standard techniques and procedures outlined by the International Organization for Standardization. Kibry-Bauer disk diffusion test was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Salmonella was isolated from 28/266 (10.5%) of the total samples. Out of the 28 Salmonella isolates, 18 (64.3%), 3 (10.7%) and 7(25%) were from lactating cows, personnel's', and equipment, respectively. Out of the 28 isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, all isolates were resistant to at least one or more antimicrobials tested. Accordingly, 96.4% (27/28), 82.1% (23/28) and 75.0% (21/28) isolates were resistant to tetracycline, kanamycin and nalidixic acid, respectively. Multiple drug resistance (resistance to two or more antimicrobials) was detected in 27(96.4%) of the isolates. Multiple antimicrobial resistance was observed in 100% (18/18), 7.4% (2/23) and 100% (7/7) of isolates obtained from lactating cows, personnels', and equipment, respectively. High proportion of multiple antimicrobial resistant isolates (96.4%) in the dairy farms alerts concern for animal and public health as these drugs is used widely for treatment and prophylaxis in animals and humans.",

Phenotypic monitoring of AMR in bacterial isolates, using microdilution methods for testing susceptibility and interpreting resistance using epidemiological cut-off values is reinforced, including further characterisation of those isolates of E. coli and Salmonella showing resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, as well as the specific monitoring of ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase-producing E. coli. Combinations of bacterial species, food-producing animals and meat, as well as antimicrobial panels have been reviewed and adapted, where deemed necessary. Considering differing sample sizes, numerical simulations have been performed to evaluate the related statistical power available for assessing occurrence and temporal trends in resistance, with a predetermined accuracy, to support the choice of harmonised sample size. Randomised sampling procedures, based on a generic proportionate stratified sampling process, have been reviewed and reinforced. Proposals to improve the harmonisation of monitoring of prevalence, genetic diversity and AMR in MRSA are presented. It is suggested to complement routine monitoring with specific cross-sectional surveys on MRSA in pigs and on AMR in bacteria from seafood and the environment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates obtained from the specific monitoring of ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase-producing E. coli is strongly advocated to be implemented, on a voluntary basis, over the validity period of the next legislation, with possible mandatory implementation by the end of the period; the gene sequences encoding for ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemases being reported to EFSA. Harmonised protocols for WGS analysis/interpretation and external quality assurance programmes are planned to be provided by the EU-Reference Laboratory on AMR.",

		"abstract": "In this study, 39 isolates of S. paratyphi B isolated from animals and the environment and one of human origin from India during 1977-2001 were characterized to understand the epidemiological distribution of this pathogen. Of the 40 isolates under the study, 24 belonged to S. paratyphi B var Java (SPBJ, utilizing d-tartrate) and 16 were S. paratyphi B (SPB, not utilizing d-tartrate). Fermentation of xylose and sorbitol and production of DNase were able to further subtype the 2 groups of S. paratyphi B (classical-SPB and var Java-SPBJ). Among the 24 isolates of SPBJ, 6 biovars namely biovar I (xylose+, sorbitol+, DNase+), 15 isolates; biovar II (xylose+, sorbitol+, DNase-), 2 isolates; biovar III (xylose-, sorbitol+, DNase+), 2 isolates; biovar IV (xylose-, sorbitol+, DNase-), 2 isolates; biovar V (xylose+, sorbitol-, DNase+), 2 isolates and biovar VI (xylose-, sorbitol-, DNase+), 1 isolate, could be identified. Isolates of biovars II to VI were isolated only from Mumbai. Of the 16 isolates, 11 (10 from fish and 1 from khoa) belonged to biotype I while the remaining 5 isolates (1 pork, 2 sewage, 1 fish and 1 human) belonged to biotype II. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) pattern of S. paratyphi B isolates revealed their resistance to dicloxacillin, cefazolin, colistin and ceftazidime and susceptibility to augmentin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, lomefloxacin, gentian violet, acriflavine and mercuric chloride. The isolates were also frequently resistant to nitrofurantoin (17 SPBJ and 9 SPB), streptomycin (2 SPB and 9 SPBJ) and cefalexin (1 SPBJ and 7 SPB). No correlation could be found between biovar and the antibiogram of the different isolates. All the SPB strains were of same bacteriocin type while 24 SPBJ isolates could be classified into 5 bacteriocin types. Bacteriocin type I was the predominant (19 isolates) and prevalent all over India while the other 4 bacteriocin types (II, III, IV and V) were prevalent only in Mumbai. The study revealed the significance of bacteriocin typing, biotyping and resistogram in understanding the epidemiology of paratyphoid infection in India.",

		"abstract": "Poultry has been identified as a reservoir of foodborne enteric pathogens and antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The objective of this study was to describe and compare antimicrobial resistant isolates from an Ontario broiler chicken farm-level baseline project (2003 to 2004) to the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) Ontario abattoir and retail surveillance data from 2003, and to the most recent (2015) CIPARS Ontario chicken surveillance data in order to assess the impact of an industry-wide policy change in antimicrobial use. Ceftiofur resistance (TIO-R) prevalence in Salmonella decreased by 7% on farm between 2003 and 2004 and 2015. During the same timeframe, TIO-R E. coli prevalence decreased significantly by 16%, 11%, and 8% in farm, abattoir, and retail samples, respectively. Gentamicin resistant (GEN-R) E. coli, however, increased by 10% in farm and 15% in retail-derived isolates, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant (TMSm-R) E. coli increased significantly by 20%, 18%, and 5% in farm, abattoir, and retail isolates, respectively. Similarly, ciprofloxacin-resistant (CIP-R) Campylobacter spp. significantly increased in retail isolates by 11% and increased in farm (33%) and abattoir isolates (7%). The decrease in TIO-R Salmonella/E. coli in recent years is consistent with the timing of an industry-led intervention eliminating the preventive use of ceftiofur, a third generation cephalosporin and class of antimicrobials deemed critically important to human medicine. The rise in GEN-R and TMSm-R prevalence is indicative of recent shifts in antimicrobial use. Our study highlights the importance of integrated surveillance in detecting emerging trends and determining the efficacy of interventions to improve food safety.",

		"abstract": "Halal foods, foods permissible per Islamic law, are a fast-growing segment of the global food industry. Most microbiological evidence about halal foods is from studies conducted in Muslim-majority countries not western (Muslim-minority) countries. We aimed to determine the microbiological quality of halal beef at both slaughter and retail in the southeastern United States as well as explore the role of Halal Certifying Bodies (HCBs) in overseeing implementation of food safety practices. The study was informed by two main hypotheses: (1) microbial load will be lower in the post-evisceration slaughter stage of beef carcass samples; (2) indicator organisms will be higher when the samples collected from small business halal and non-halal meat markets. A total of 432 beef carcass samples and 59 Environmental samples from two halal beef slaughterhouses and 138 beef cuts (72 halal beef and 66 non-halal beef) from small retail markets were collected each month between November 2016 and October 2017. All samples were analyzed for the presence of indicator organisms-aerobic plate counts (APCs), generic Escherichia coli (ECCs), total coliform counts (TCCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs). Samples taken between June and September 2017 were also analyzed for Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7, and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (non-O157 STEC). In all slaughterhouse samples, the levels of indicator microorganisms were below the maximum acceptable microbial limits established by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods and the European Union. A significant relationship (P ˃0.03) was shown between APCs, ECCs, TCCs, and ECs and detectable levels of pathogenic non-O157 STEC and Salmonella spp. In pre-evisceration samples. High levels of indicator microorganisms were shown in both halal and non-halal retail meat samples suggesting operation size not halal or non-halal meat classification is associated with microbiological quality. These data can be used to inform food safety interventions targeting halal meat operations in the southeastern United States. Representatives from HCBs concluded that federal government agencies (i.e., USDA/FSIS, FDA) have excellent programs in place to ensure implementing food safety practices in food manufacturing environments. These individuals also stated that the role of HCBs was to verify that all records and documents of food safety are in place and in compliance with government regulations. Our study confirmed that food safety and halal are in tandem in the United States as halal standards imply safe.

		"abstract": "Salmonella can either be controlled pre-harvest, post-harvest or by a combination of both approaches. This paper describes the lessons learned in Danish Salmonella surveillance and control programme for finisher pigs and pork. Initially, main focus was on pre-harvest initiatives and correct identification of herds with respect to the risk for Salmonella that they represented. However, an analysis of risk-mitigating actions applied along the chain from stable to table showed that it would be more cost-effective to deal with Salmonella on the abattoirs than in the herds. This knowledge moved focus from pre- to post-harvest without giving up on pre-harvest surveillance. First of all, this meant increased attention on slaughter hygiene and individual interventions in the abattoirs. In brief, we learned that for a programme to be successful it must be based on standardised methods for sampling and testing to be able to evaluate and compare performance of the programme. More specifically, meat-juice samples taken from finisher pigs at the time of slaughter are an effective way of identifying high-risk herds for Salmonella. In addition, a penalty system might act as an incentive for farmers to deal with Salmonella in their herd. Additionally, common targets for all abattoirs allowing for unique control solutions should be adapted. Finally, decontamination techniques like hot water decontamination are a feasible way of dealing with high-risk pigs (Level-3 pigs). The current prevalence in Danish pork is around 1.2%, and a target is set to <1.0% to be reached by the end of 2013. The experience obtained by use of the Danish programme might be used to develop and implement appropriate types of surveillance programs as well as risk-mitigating measures in other countries.

		"abstract": "Background: This study was conducted to examine the frequency of contamination in retail meat available in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology: Raw meat samples (250) and surface swabs (90) from meat processing equipment and the surrounding environment were analyzed for microbiological contamination. Results: Out of 340 samples, 84% were found to be contaminated with bacterial species, including Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. A total of 550 (66%) of the bacterial isolates were potential pathogens. Of these, 342 and 208 isolates were from meat and environmental samples respectively. Food-borne pathogens isolated from meat samples included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella Enteritidis and Shigella species whereas environmental samples yielded Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella species. Four strains of Brucella species were also isolated from meat samples. Total aerobic counts ranged between 108-1010 CFU/g or cm2. Resistance to a wide range of antibiotics was observed. Resistance rates to ampicillin, amoxicillin, novobiocin and cefaclor were from 62 to 75% in general. Thirty-three percent of Salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin. No quinolone resistance was observed. Biofilm formation was observed among 88 (16%) pathogenic bacteria including E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusions: Food-borne pathogens found in retail shops could be sources for horizontal contamination of meat. Our data confirm the circulation of antibiotic resistant and biofilm forming pathogens in raw meat and its environment in retail shops in Pakistan, which could play a role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance amongst food-borne bacteria.",

		"abstract": "Facile laboratory tools are needed to augment identification in contamination events to trace the contamination back to the source (traceback) of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). Understanding the evolution and diversity within and among outbreak strains is the first step towards this goal. To this end, we collected 106 new S. Enteriditis isolates within S. Enteriditis Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern JEGX01.0004 and close relatives, and determined their genome sequences. Sources for these isolates spanned food, clinical and environmental farm sources collected during the 2010 S. Enteritidis shell egg outbreak in the United States along with closely related serovars, S. Dublin, S. Gallinarum biovar Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. Despite the highly homogeneous structure of this population, S. Enteritidis isolates examined in this study revealed thousands of SNP differences and numerous variable genes (n=366). Twenty-one of these genes from the lineages leading to outbreak-associated samples had nonsynonymous (causing amino acid changes) changes and five genes are putatively involved in known Salmonella virulence pathways. While chromosome synteny and genome organization appeared to be stable among these isolates, genome size differences were observed due to variation in the presence or absence of several phages and plasmids, including phage RE-2010, phage P125109, plasmid pSEEE3072_19 (similar to pSENV), plasmid pOU1114 and two newly observed mobile plasmid elements pSEEE1729_15 and pSEEE0956_35. These differences produced modifications to the assembled bases for these draft genomes in the size range of approximately 4.6 to 4.8 mbp, with S. Dublin being larger (~4.9 mbp) and S. Gallinarum smaller (4.55 mbp) when compared to S. Enteritidis. Finally, we identified variable S. Enteritidis genes associated with virulence pathways that may be useful markers for the development of rapid surveillance and typing methods, potentially aiding in traceback efforts during future outbreaks involving S. Enteritidis PFGE pattern JEGX01.0004.",

		"abstract": "Restaurants serve more than 70 billion meals in the U.S. each year. Annually, approximately 48 million foodborne illnesses occur in the U.S., yet only over 800 foodborne disease outbreaks get reported. From 1998-2013, 56% of the 17,445 outbreaks reported were associated with restaurants. While scientifically validated cleaning and sanitation strategies are available, microbial cross-contamination from environmental surfaces remains an issue. For instance, previous research shows that the cleaning tool itself can become a source of contamination. The objective of this study was to test if a flatware rest provides a physical barrier between contaminated tabletop surfaces and eating utensils. Data confirmed that flatware rests prevented the contamination of utensils from microorganisms when compared with utensils placed directly on surfaces inoculated with E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and MS2 bacteriophage (a surrogate for norovirus). This study demonstrates that flatware rests are a practical solution to prevent cross-contamination of foodborne pathogens from tabletop to utensil, and potentially are an added layer of consumer protection.",

		"abstract": "Estimating optimal sample size for microbiological surveys is a challenge for laboratory managers. When insufficient sampling is conducted, biased inferences are likely; however, when excessive sampling is conducted valuable laboratory resources are wasted. This report presents a statistical model for the estimation of the sample size appropriate for the accurate identification of the bacterial subtypes of interest in a specimen. This applied model for microbiology laboratory use is based on a Bayesian mode of inference, which combines two inputs: (ii) a prespecified estimate, or prior distribution statement, based on available scientific knowledge and (ii) observed data. The specific inputs for the model are a prior distribution statement of the number of strains per specimen provided by an informed microbiologist and data from a microbiological survey indicating the number of strains per specimen. The model output is an updated probability distribution of strains per specimen, which can be used to estimate the probability of observing all strains present according to the number of colonies that are sampled. In this report two scenarios that illustrate the use of the model to estimate bacterial colony sample size requirements are presented. In the first scenario, bacterial colony sample size is estimated to correctly identify Campylobacter amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism types on broiler carcasses. The second scenario estimates bacterial colony sample size to correctly identify Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis phage types in fecal drag swabs from egg-laying poultry flocks. An advantage of the model is that as updated inputs from ongoing surveys are incorporated into the model, increasingly precise sample size estimates are likely to be made.",

		"abstract": "A wide portion of the low-moisture food processing industry is comprised of legacy thermal processes (e.g., roasting, toasting, baking, drying) that were historically designed, implemented, and operated to achieve food quality goals, rather than food safety outcomes. However, under the FSMA Preventive Controls rules, such processes must be validated to achieve appropriate pathogen (Salmonella) reduction, regardless of their historical track record, unless additional unit operations are specifically implemented for pasteurization. Given the enhanced thermal resistance of Salmonella in low-moisture systems, the dynamic and complex heat and mass transfer phenomena occurring during these processes, and the difficulty in real-time monitoring of critical variables, validation of such processes is not a trivial task. Additionally, particularly for small and medium-sized processors, investment in stand-alone pasteurization technologies might not be feasible, making validation and/or modification of existing processes essential from both a regulatory and economic perspective. Therefore, this symposium will present analyses of three possible pathways for processors to meet this challenge: (1) Using a systems (hurdle) approach to ensuring pathogen reduction in low moisture foods; (2) Modifying existing processes that might otherwise be insufficient as traditionally operated, in order to enhance pathogen reduction; and (3) Choosing among various options for stand-alone pasteurization technologies. The speakers will present an overview of these approaches, including the regulatory expectations, recent research results across multiple products and processes, and a critical review of the state-of-technology for pasteurization options, from the perspective of multi-criteria decision analysis.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella isolates were collected from 2 commercial turkey processing plants (A and B) located in different US geographical locations. Isolates recovered at different stages of processing were subjected to 2 genotype techniques [PAGE and denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] to determine their usefulness for Salmonella serotyping. Primers used for PCR amplification were to a highly conserved spacer region located between the 16S and 23S rDNA genes. Sampling sites at plant A were 1) postscald, 2) pre-inside-outside bird wash, 3) post-IOBW, and 4) postchill with 30, 44, 36, and 12 Salmonella isolates recovered, respectively. Plant B had an additional site and these locations were 1) prescald, 2) postscald, 3) pre-inside-outside bird wash, 4) post-IOBW, and 5) postchill with 16, 54, 24, 35, and 24 Salmonella isolates recovered, respectively. In plant A, 4 different Salmonella serotypes were identified: Derby, Hadar, Montevideo, and Senftenberg. In plant B, 10 serotypes were identified: Agona, Anatum, Brandenburg, Derby, Hadar, Meleagridis, Montevideo, Reading, Senftenberg, and Typhimurium. Salmonella Derby was predominant in plant A (83%), whereas Salmonella Typhimurium was the most common serotype recovered in plant B (39%). Genotype analyses of the Salmonella serotypes were expressed in dendrograms with comparisons interpreted as percentage similarity coefficients. Both PAGE and DGGE were able to distinguish serotype band patterns. However, DGGE was more discriminating than PAGE. Isolates of the same serotypes were grouped together on the dendrogram of band patterns generated by DGGE. In contrast, PAGE failed to group all like serotypes together on the corresponding dendrogram. The results of the study suggest that genotyping techniques can be very useful in discriminating Salmonella serotypes collected from the processing plant environment of commercial poultry production. These molecular techniques may offer more cost-effective means to identify Salmonella serotypes from large numbers of isolates and with more immediate results than those currently achieved with conventional typing techniques.",

A survey was performed to collect samples of tchachanga and data related to hygienic conditions of the roasted meat processing environment. A total of 60 samples of tchachanga including skewers, roasted meat and seasoned wrapped meat were collected from different processing sites in Cotonou, Benin. The main food borne microorganisms involved were investigated using standard methods. Moreover, a follow-up of tchachanga processing was performed to identify contamination factors of the product. In this respect, samples were collected at certain steps during the processing, and various microorganisms such as coliforms, pathogenic Staphylococcus and Salmonella were traced. The number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria in different products ranged between 6.470.61 and 6.930.43 Log (cfu/g). Total coliforms, faecal coliforms and Staphylococci ranged from 1.59 to 4.79, 1.00 to 3.2 and 3.49 to 5.2 Log (cfu/g), respectively. No significant differences were observed in the microbial count of different types of tchachanga investigated, but different processing methods had significant changes in the microbial content of the samples as a result of the processing environments and the ingredients used. The presence of Salmonella sp. was observed in all products.",

The method was developed in the Rhone-Alpes region of France, and is now used in >200 farm dairies. The method is similar to a HACCP system, but focuses particularly on microorganisms stipulated in hygiene legislation relating to the small-scale production of soft cheeses (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli), and on action to be taken in the event of these pathogens being detected. Dairies adopting the system review their practices annually with an external assessor. The first article discusses the Olivier method and its practical operation; the second is an interview with a farmer/cheesemaker in the Ardeche who was involved with the development of the method, discussing its origins and acceptability to farmers; the third examines the application of the method to a farm dairy manufacturing ewe and goat milk cheeses; and the final article considers the results of a survey of farmers carried out in the Rhone-Alpes region to determine their attitudes to hygiene regulation, and the extent of their knowledge of the effects of different pathogens on human health.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella contamination has remained problematic in broiler chicken industry worldwide. The contamination could establish in any steps from production, transportation, processing to consumption. Therefore, identification of source of Salmonella was a key to control the contamination from broiler farms to slaughter houses. So far the control measures have focused on the Salmonella detection without enumeration and were not based on the data with respect to concentration and prevalence. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for Salmonella concentration and prevalence by regression analysis in the broiler processing plant. The concentration data were analyzed by multiple regression and demonstrated that water pressure in the inside outside washer and line speed were significant predictors or risk factors for Salmonella concentration in broiler chicken (P<0.05). In addition, the amount of washing water in defeathering step was also a potential risk factor. The regression model could not significantly explain the observed data (P>0.05) perhaps due to high statistical variance. The prevalence data analyzed by logistic regression could not identify significant risk factor for Salmonella prevalence. However, prevalence of Salmonella after the evisceration step was considered as a potential risk factor for Salmonella prevalence in broiler chicken. The model validation for Salmonella concentration was not significant. Increasing sample size of further study could warrant the validity of model.",

		"abstract": "Salmonellosis is an infectious disease whose main clinical manifestation is acute gastroenteritis caused by consumption of contaminated water or food especially meat. The aim of this study was to determine the Salmonella spp. prevalence inside pork and the environment from 6 slaughterhouses and 14 butcher's shops all of them selected in Tolima region. A convenience study was realized, choosing slaughterhouses depending on animal reception charge and the good manufacture practices. Sample were obtained (n=507) from environment samples were realized smears on knives, tables, hooks, waste pipes, floors, and transportation trucks. Samples were under microbiologic analysis for Salmonella isolation, which was identified by biochemical and serological test (Poli A+Vi). The results showed a prevalence of Salmonella spp. of 4.93% (25/507). 14 out 25 positives (56%) were isolated from carcass and 11 remaining (44%) were isolated from environment; in slaughterhouses as well as butcher's shops. In conclusion, Isolation of Salmonella spp. in post-production phases can be due to cross contamination with environmental fomites in transport as well as in butcher's shops and it's important for the risk in public health. This is the first time, in the Tolima region that the Salmonella prevalence is known in slaughterhouses and butcher's shops.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella is one of the major foodborne pathogens worldwide. Pork products are among the main sources of Salmonella infection in humans, and several countries have established Salmonella surveillance and control programs. The role of slaughtering in carcass contamination has been indicated by studies focused on the slaughterhouse environment. In this review, we examine and discuss the information available regarding the influence that farm status, pig transport, and lairage have on the carriage of Salmonella by pigs entering the slaughter line. The evolution of carcass contamination throughout the slaughtering process, the main sources of contamination in the dirty and clean zones of the slaughter line, and previously reported prevalence of Salmonella on carcasses and factors affecting this prevalence also are discussed. The importance of implementing interventions at the slaughter level is discussed briefly. Consistent with the information available, pigs from infected farms and newly acquired or recrudescent infections in pigs at the subsequent stages of transport and lairage are important sources of Salmonella at the slaughtering plant. The continuous introduction of Salmonella into the slaughterhouse and the potential for resident flora constitute a risk for carcass contamination. At the slaughterhouse, some dressing activities can reduce carcass contamination, but others are critical control points that jeopardize carcass hygiene. This information indicates the importance of considering slaughter and previous stages in the pork production chain for controlling Salmonella in swine production.",

		"abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the slaughtering process in Salmonella carcass contamination by typing isolates recovered previously in a double study of the following: (1) a tracking survey from the farm to the slaughterhouse and (2) a survey of the slaughterhouse environment (i.e., lairage area, slaughter line, cutting plant and carcasses). The Salmonella serotypes identified on the carcasses of the 16 tracked batches were frequently linked to lairage, whereas the serotypes detected at the farm, transport or pig-related samples (i.e., caecum content and lymph nodes) were only occasionally detected at the carcass level. Multi-locus variable-number tandem repeats (MLVA) of 77 Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium isolates from seven of these batches confirmed the link between the isolates recovered from carcasses and holding pens. Only four of the 16 positive carcasses had profiles previously isolated from lymph nodes or caecal content. In the second part of the study, a total of 131 S. enterica ser. Typhimurium and 74 S. enterica ser. Derby isolates were further characterised by MLVA and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), respectively. The MLVA profiles identified in carcasses varied throughout the working day and were frequently linked to those identified in samples from the slaughter line points collected close in time. PFGE and MLVA profiles identified at lairage were also detected in later processing facilities (i.e., slaughter line and cutting plant) as well as in carcasses. Finally, most of the profiles found at the cutting plants were previously identified in the slaughter line or carcass samples. The results from this study show that Salmonella contamination in pigs entering the slaughterhouse can be attributed to several sources. Typing of isolates by MLVA and PFGE clarified the sources of carcass contamination and improved the accuracy of cross-contamination attributable values. Without obviating the relevant role of infected pigs entering the slaughterhouse, the present study highlights the lairage and slaughtering as important sources of carcass contamination.",

		"abstract": "Over the past few years, the demand for the introduction of fish products in public canteens (schools, hospitals and nursing-homes) has grown due to their good nutritional proprieties. The particular health conditions and sensitivity of some groups of consumers exposes them to greater risks of food poisoning. It is therefore important to monitor the raw materials that end up in mass catering implementing strategies of mass catering control, both with self-monitoring strategies and with regular controls performed by the competent health authorities. The purpose of this study is to assess the overall quality of seafood dealt out from public catering services located in Northeast Italy. In this paper we illustrate the results of microbiological analysis performed on 135 fish samples (58% of samples were raw fishes, 27% cooked fishes, 6% raw fish products, 9% cooked fish products) and species identification performed on 102 fish samples. Additionally, 135 environmental swabs were collected to determine the effectiveness of cleaning and sanitation of food contact (cutting boards, cooking equipment and food processing surfaces) and non-contact (refrigerator wall and handle, tap lever) surfaces. Of raw seafood samples, 24% had total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count >10âµ CFU/g and for Enterobacteriaceae the faecal contamination was excluded since no Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli were isolated. Just 3.8% of raw seafood samples resulted positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The results of swab samples of cooking utensils and surfaces showed that sanitation practices should be improved. Molecular analysis for fish species identification revealed a mislabelling for 25% of sampled fishes. The results of this survey can provide valuable information for monitoring and surveillance programmes for the control of quality of fish and fish products.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella is one of the top causes for bacterial foodborne infections in the United States, emphasizing the importance of controlling this pathogen for protecting public health. Poultry and poultry products are commonly associated with Salmonella, and interventions during production and processing are necessary to manage the risk of infection due to consumption of poultry products. In recent times, the demand for organic and antibiotic-free poultry has increased owing to consumer perceptions and concerns of increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens. However, the microbiological effect of these management practices is not clear. This study was conducted to determine the difference in the AMR of Salmonella isolated from poultry processed conventionally and organically. Fecal samples, carcass rinses, and environmental samples were collected over 1 year and analyzed for the prevalence of Salmonella and AMR. Results of this experiment showed that organic chickens were associated with statistically higher levels of Salmonella during early processing steps. However, no difference in Salmonella prevalence was observed between organic and conventional carcasses postchill. In addition, for most antimicrobial agents tested, prevalence of AMR Salmonella in conventional processing was lower in this study than was reported by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for chickens at slaughter. These observations indicate that organic methods may introduce greater risk of Salmonella contamination; however, proper interventions during processing can abate this risk. In addition, this study supports the assertion that raising chickens without the use of antibiotics may result in lower prevalence of AMR Salmonella.",

Fluorescence intensity of stained preparations was evaluated semi-automatically using a fluorescence microscope, with a sensor in the camera mount and any signals above a pre-determined threshold level being recorded on a chart recorder. Fluorescent samples were examined visually to confirm that fluorescence was due to stained bacteria. Results were compared with those from standard cultural methods. For 144 sub-samples from 67 food, feed and environmental samples, there was overall agreement of 89.6% with cultural methods, with 6.9% false positives and 3.5% false negatives. No salmonellas were detected in the 1 sample of dried milk tested. The semi-automatic method saves about 18 h compared with cultural methods.",

In this study, we determined both hygienic-sanitary risk and microbiological quality of raw ground beef and meat contact surfaces in butcher shops from Neuquen Province, Argentina. The hygienic-sanitary risk of the butcher shops was characterized based on the quantitative results of a checklist. A total of 44 raw ground meat and 49 meat contact surfaces were sampled. Most butcher shops presented low/moderate hygienic-sanitary risk, and one had high-risk. Counts of indicator microorganisms in ground meat samples were as follows: mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, 6.6 log CFU/g; S. aureus, 1.1 log CFU/g; E. coli, 1.5 log CFU/g. Pathogen microorganisms were found in 15.9% of ground beef samples (Salmonella spp., 6.8%; E. coli O157:H7, 2.3%; non-O157 STEC, 6.8%) and 28.6% of environmental samples (Salmonella spp., 6.1%; non-O157 STEC, 2%; L. monocytogenes, 22.4%). Concomitantly, Salmonella spp. was detected in raw ground beef and meat contact surface samples from two butcher shops. Ribotyping of these strains revealed cross-contamination. Risk quantification was useful to identify failures in different areas of the butcher shops and recognize potential improvements to reduce the risk of pathogenic bacteria contamination of meat and ready-to-eat products.",

The multiplex PCR used in this investigation was established by Kim et al. to serotype the 30 most common clinical Salmonella serotypes, as determined by CDC. The PCR assay consists of two five-plex reactions and a single two-plex PCR reaction, based on six genetic loci from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and four loci from S. enterica serotype Typhi. In this investigation, we further evaluated the method for serotyping Salmonella spp. using a reference collection, environmental samples collected from a Mid-Atlantic region tomato farm study, four food matrices spiked with different Salmonella serotypes and a proficiency test. The PCR assay was first evaluated using DNA isolated from pure cultures of isolates obtained from various clinical and environmental samples, and then DNA isolated from broth cultures of food matrices of \"Red round\" and Roma tomatoes, Romaine lettuce, green onions and Serrano peppers spiked with serotypes Newport, Typhimurium, Javiana and Saintpaul, respectively. The results showed that the PCR assay correctly serotyped Salmonella spp. from the clinical, environmental, spiked food matrices, and proficiency test samples. These findings are significant because the PCR assay was successful in the identification of Salmonella in the spiked samples in a broth culture containing other non-salmonella organism. This method may be a useful resource for the food safety community.",

		"abstract": "Increasing demands for \"minimally processed\" fresh produce create a potential market niche in high-value markets for South African smallholder farmers. Fresh produce not meeting required microbiological quality criteria causes consumer health concerns and therefore limits market access. This study determined selected smallholder farmer pre-and-post-harvest practices and their potential contributions to the microbiological quality of \"minimally processed\" fresh produce and thus potential implications for market access. Survey results indicated that most smallholder farmers used animal manure as fertilizer (74%) and that their knowledge of potential contamination sources was poor. Microbiological analysis showed that a number of irrigation water samples did not meet WHO recommendations for fecal coliform levels and exceeded the South African standard for E. coli for irrigation water applied to \"minimally processed\" fresh produce. Lettuce, parsley, carrots, and spinach collected over at least 3-months were frequently of unsatisfactory quality with respect to total coliform (ranging from 130 to 79000 MPN/g) and E. coli levels (ranging from 2.2 to 49 MPN/g) according to South African Department of Health recommendations. While surfaces within the processing chain harbored E. coli, Salmonella spp. was not detected on surfaces, in fresh produce or irrigation water samples analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 155 randomly selected E. coli isolates from fresh produce and irrigation water were determined by using a disk diffusion method, showing high percentages of resistance for streptomycin (95%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (32%). In addition, the ability of E. coli isolates from fresh produce to form biofilms was shown. The identification of antibiotic-resistant and biofilm forming E. coli from fresh produce and within the production environment highlights the importance of pre-and post-harvest hygiene practices, especially if smallholder farmers intend on supplying high-value markets.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella is a diverse genus of Gram-negative bacilli and a major foodborne pathogen responsible for more than a million illnesses annually in the United States alone. Rapid, reliable detection and identification of this pathogen in food and environmental sources is key to safeguarding the food supply. Traditional microbiological culture techniques have been the 'gold standard' for State and Federal regulators. Unfortunately, the time to result is too long to effectively monitor foodstuffs, especially those with very short shelf lives. Advances in traditional microbiology and molecular biology over the past 25 years have greatly improved the speed at which this pathogen is detected. Nonetheless, food and environmental samples possess a distinctive set of challenges for these newer, more rapid methodologies. Furthermore, more detailed identification and subtyping strategies still rely heavily on the availability of a pure isolate. However, major shifts in DNA sequencing technologies are meeting this challenge by advancing the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella towards a culture-independent diagnostic framework. This review will focus on current approaches and state-of-the-art next-generation advances in the detection, identification and subtyping of Salmonella from food and environmental sources.",

		"abstract": "Pathogen environmental monitoring programs (EMPs) are essential for food processing facilities of all sizes that produce ready-to-eat food products exposed to the processing environment. We developed, implemented, and evaluated EMPs targeting Listeria spp. and Salmonella in nine small cheese processing facilities, including seven farmstead facilities. Individual EMPs with monthly sample collection protocols were designed specifically for each facility. Salmonella was detected in only one facility, with likely introduction from the adjacent farm indicated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data. Listeria spp. were isolated from all nine facilities during routine sampling. The overall Listeria spp. (other than Listeria monocytogenes) and L. monocytogenes prevalences in the 4,430 environmental samples collected were 6.03 and 1.35%, respectively. Molecular characterization and subtyping data suggested persistence of a given Listeria spp. strain in seven facilities and persistence of L. monocytogenes in four facilities. To assess routine sampling plans, validation sampling for Listeria spp. was performed in seven facilities after at least 6 months of routine sampling. This validation sampling was performed by independent individuals and included collection of 50 to 150 samples per facility, based on statistical sample size calculations. Two of the facilities had a significantly higher frequency of detection of Listeria spp. during the validation sampling than during routine sampling, whereas two other facilities had significantly lower frequencies of detection. This study provides a model for a science- and statistics-based approach to developing and validating pathogen EMPs.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella is a worldwide public health issue and the European Union (EU) has showed clear initiatives to take on the challenge of reducing Salmonella in food animal production. The European Union countries have a very diverse Salmonella situation, ranging from some countries having negligible levels in the food animal production to other countries where Salmonella is highly prevalent. The dominant serotypes of Salmonella vary between regions and countries. Most serotypes do not cause clinical disease in animals, but are more of public health concern. The EU has been implementing an enhanced monitoring and control of Salmonella in food animal production. Producers are now sharing the responsibility for the safety of food production. Egg and egg products are considered the major Salmonella risk food source for humans, and the Salmonella control programmes have initially been targeted to the poultry production. Meanwhile, there is legislation and plans to implement Salmonella reduction measures in pig production. These EU plans are however pending a cost benefit assessment. The methods of reduction of Salmonella will vary dependent on food animal production species, the agricultural infrastructure, prevalence in the animal population, resources and focus of the industry concerned. All member states have Salmonella control programmes in poultry, starting with the breeding birds, and some member states have initiated control programmes in pigs and cattle based on antibody titres to Salmonella. This paper will briefly present the Salmonella scenario in Europe, the Salmonella legislative measures, the control programmes, and some of the challenges of reversing the Salmonella trend in food animal production.",

		"abstract": "The development and spread of antimicrobial multidrug resistance of Salmonella spp. from food chain is a public health concern global. This study aimed to describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 283 isolates of Salmonella enterica from pork slaughterhouse in Colombia. Antimicrobial susceptibility on ten antimicrobials was evaluated: amoxicillin - clavulanic acid (30 ug), ampicillin (10 ug), ceftiofur (30 ug), ciprofloxacin (5 ug), chloramphenicol (30 ug), florfenicol (30 ug), gentamicin (10 ug), sulfadiazine/trimethoprim (25 ug), tetracycline (30 ug) and tilmicosin (15 ug) using the disc diffusion method. The results showed the high presence of isolates multidrug resistant of Salmonella enterica widespread on environmental of slaughterhouse (46.64% n: 132). 52 multidrug resistance patterns were detected. The most common was ceftiofur - tetracycline - tilmicosin in 9.89% (n=28) of isolates. These same three antimicrobials were less effective with 96.82% (n=274) resistant-isolates against tetracycline, 73.14% (n=207) against tilmicosin and 28.27% (n=80) against ceftiofur. Of particular concern was the high rate of resistance to ceftiofur due to its cross-resistance to ceftriaxone. The results demonstrate the need to promote and strengthen an official Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance and volunteer monitoring systems in each link of the porcine production chain, to contribute to the prevention and control of food-borne infections in the context of safety management system in Colombia.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted where a simple random sampling method was used to select butcher shops, and the municipal abattoir was purposively selected. A structured questionnaire survey was also used to assess hygienic status of the municipal abattoir and butcher shops. A total of 124 samples (48 swab samples from abattoir carcass, 4 samples of carcass washing water about 20 ml of each, and 36 swab samples each from butcher shop cutting table and cutting knife, respectively) were collected during the study period. The collected samples were processed for aerobic plate count, and the total mean count was found to be 4.53 log10 cfu/cm2 from abattoir carcass swab samples, 2.4 log10 cfu/ml from water samples, 6.58 log10 cfu/cm2 from butcher shops cutting table, and 6.1 log10 cfu/cm2 from cutting knife swab samples. E. coli was the dominant bacterial species isolated (35.2%), followed by S. aureus (22.5%) and Salmonellae species (9.9%). According to the questionnaire survey, 48.4% (15/31) of the abattoir workers did not receive any training regarding food safety issues. Moreover, a majority (66.67%) of the respondents of the butcher house workers were grade 1-4 (elementary) in their educational level and do not use hairnet and handle money with bare hands during serving meat to consumers. The study showed that the hygienic status of the abattoir and butcher shops in the study area is poor, and the obtained results of bacterial load are higher than the acceptable limit of the standard. Therefore, the necessary strategies towards hygiene and sanitation of meat in the town should be implemented.",

		"abstract": "During the summer of 2005, an increase in reports of human cases of Salmonella enterica serovar Ohio infection was observed in Belgium. During 11 weeks, between 1 July and 13 September, 60 cases of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Ohio infection were reported to the National Reference Centre for Salmonella, with a peak onset of symptoms in the third week of July. All clinical isolates caused self-limiting gastroenteritis; both genders (32 males and 28 females) and all age groups (three children <5 years of age, three children 5 to 14 years of age, 32 adults 15 to 64 years of age, and 22 adults >65 years of age) were affected. The isolates were distributed throughout Belgium but a cluster of several cases was observed around Brussels. At the same time, an increase in the incidence of this serovar was observed in the Salmonella isolates originating from the official surveillance campaign conducted by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, which identified pork as a likely source of the outbreak strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing confirmed the clonal relationship between the human isolates, the isolates from samples collected in the cutting plants, and the isolates from pork meat in distribution. Further epidemiological investigations indicated that one particular slaughterhouse was involved. In that slaughterhouse, the carcasses were contaminated during the evisceration process because of contaminated equipment and uncontrolled environmental conditions. This study highlights the importance of a centralized surveillance laboratory in the management of outbreaks and the need of strict implementation of hygienic rules to avoid this type of outbreak.",

Rapid advances in “big data” technologies such as genomics and metagenomics are making it possible to monitor and control salmonellosis in new and exciting ways. Epidemiological methods are becoming increasingly robust through the routine use of standardized hypothesis-generating questionnaires, iterative open-ended interviewing, informational trace-backs and new modeling techniques for describing the attribution of disease to food sources. In addition, Salmonella epidemiology is facing important challenges and new opportunities due to the rapid adoption of culture independent diagnostic test panels by clinical laboratories.

The cloth captured extracted lipopolysaccharide Salmonella antigens which were then detected by a bacterium-specific antibody. Efficacy of the polymyxin-cloth enzyme immunoassay (p-CEIA) in detecting Salmonella in foods, feeds and environmental samples was examined. Samples of dried milk and dried whey, dried egg, whole eggs, cheese, butter, ice cream, samples from Canadian food plants, grain-based animal feeds and feed supplements were pre-enriched for 24 h prior to selective enrichment. After each stage of enrichment, p-CEIA was used to assay samples. Results were compared with those obtained by the standard technique recommended by Health Canada and the Modified Semi-Solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV) method. p-CEIA did not give any false positive or negative results with any of the food samples tested and showed complete agreement with results from the standard culture technique. The assay was able to identify a greater number of Salmonella in samples than the MSRV method. The highest recovery of Salmonella from environmental samples and feeds by p-CEIA was obtained when brain-heart infusion broth containing 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% cholate and 0.3% selenite was used as the selective medium. It is concluded that p-CEIA is effective for screening selective enrichment cultures of foods, feeds and environmental samples for Salmonella.",

Methods: Five sites/tools in each of 200 randomly selected restaurant kitchens were examined for the presence of presumptive Salmonella spp. by enrichment. Serotyping, antibiotic resistance studies and genotyping were performed using the Kauffmann-White, CLSI and PulseNet methods, respectively. Survival/growth was investigated in milk, meat and vegetable products. Results: Presumptive isolates from 15 of the 200 restaurant kitchens were recovered and confirmed as Salmonella positive. Seven different serovars showing a variety of antibiotic resistance profiles were detected. PFGE profiles suggested that isolates from geographically adjacent restaurants were related. Salmonella survived in foods stored at typical catering refrigeration temperatures and increased by approximately 0.8 log10 CFU ml-1 per day in food products stored under conditions of thermal abuse (20°C). Conclusions: Inadequate hygiene has resulted in contamination of restaurant kitchens with Salmonella, which may persist/multiply in cross-contaminated foods. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study highlights the need for greater hygiene in restaurant kitchens coupled with rapid chilling of food not for immediate consumption and reheating before subsequent serving.",

		"abstract": "In this study, important sources and disseminations of Salmonella in integrated broiler meat production was conducted in the north-eastern part of Thailand during 2010-2012. Both environmental samples and chicken-related samples from three broiler meat production cycles, starting from breeder farm, hatchery, broiler farm, and slaughterhouse were collected. The chicken-related samples were tested to monitor Salmonella status of the chickens, eggs, or whole carcasses, whereas the environmental samples were tested to investigate the possible sources of Salmonella contamination. A total of 1,449 chicken-related samples and 802 environmental samples were analyzed. Results of this study showed that Salmonella was found in all production units. Horizontal transmission was considered as the main route of Salmonella contamination in this integrated broiler production. No Salmonella contamination was found in any of the egg samples. Important sources of Salmonella during the broiler production were contaminated environment and equipment in hatchery, contaminated day-old chicks, feed, and pests especially house lizards. In addition, the main factors for Salmonella dissemination to the chicken carcasses were contaminated transport cages, transportation of broilers to slaughterhouse, and cross-contamination during the slaughter process. Therefore, effective top-to-down Salmonella controlling approach should be implemented; especially for sanitary programs, feed quality control, water treatment, pest management and HACCP plan in the slaughterhouse.",

		"abstract": "AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in pigs at the moment of slaughter and in the slaughterhouse environment. METHODS AND  RESULTS: In total, five different commercial slaughterhouses were sampled during  eight slaughterhouse visits. Carcass swabs, colon content and mesenteric lymph nodes  were taken to reflect the animal status and from the slaughterhouse environmental  samples were taken. Salmonella was isolated from 37% of the carcass samples as a  mean value. High variations were noticed between different slaughterhouses (between  0 and 70%) and sampling days in the same abattoir (between 3 and 52%). A correlation  was found between the carcass contamination and the status of the delivered animals  (P=0.01675). Cross contamination was estimated to account for 29% of the positive  carcasses. The slaughterhouse environment was highly contaminated; before starting  the slaughtering activities 25% of the samples were positive on average. The most  prevalent serotypes isolated at the slaughterhouse environment and from the colon  content were S. Typhimurium, S. Livingstone and S. Derby. On carcasses S.  Typhimurium was predominately isolated (71%). The biggest variability of serotypes  was found in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Serologically 56.3% of the pigs were found  positive for Salmonella using a cut-off level of the optical density percentage  higher than 10 (O.D.% > or = 10). While on individual pig level the correlation  between the bacteriological and serological data was poor, because of recent  Salmonella infections, a better correlation was found at the herd level on the  moment of slaughtering. CONCLUSION: A high degree of carcass contamination is  noticed after slaughtering. This contamination resulted from the delivery of  Salmonella-positive pigs and cross-contamination from the slaughterhouse  environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In pigs, Salmonella carriage is  high, but it is obvious that slaughterhouse hygiene is a determinative factor for  managing carcass contamination.",

		"abstract": "Three meat or poultry processors required validation of critical control points (CCP) in their HACCP plants to satisfy USDA requirements for HACCP implementation. In-plant data, including product/room temp., total aerobic plate counts, coliform and generic Escherichiacoli counts, and data on the presence of Salmonella, were collected in order to establish or modify CCP in the processes. Measurement of product temp. as a CCP in a chicken portioning operation performed in a non-refrigerated area was validated. Over the course of a day, no significant increases in product temp. or microbial load on the food contact surfaces were measured. Data were collected from a processing line producing sub-primal cuts of beef from cattle carcasses, allowing monitoring of room temp. as the CCP as opposed to product temp. Again, microbial load on food contact surfaces did not increase as long as the room temp. remained near 50°F for <4 h. Finally, data were collected to determine the critical limits for a CCP during processing of cured pork trim. Microbial loads on the cured pork fat and skin trim increased significantly during chilling. In response, a new improved chilling method in a brine solution was implemented to reduce temp. quickly and thus inhibit microbial growth. All 3 processors presented the data to the USDA and were subsequently allowed to operate using the new validated parameters.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the resistance and multiresistant patterns of strains of Salmonella spp. isolated in a poultry processing plant in Zulia State, to quinolones and fluoroquinolones (Nalidixic acid=Na, ciprofloxacin=Cf, and enrofloxacin=Ex), as well as other antimicrobial drugs: tetracycline (T), oxytetracycline (O), neomycin (N), nitrofurantoin (Nf), trimethoprim (Tr) and chloramphenicol (C). A total of 146 Salmonella isolates were obtained from different sources: 34 strains from pools of Intestines (duodenal and colon) and internal organs (liver and spleen); 87 strains of carcass samples collected in four different phases: carcasses after defeathering, evisceration, chilling, and final packed products; 8 strains from edible by-products (neck, liver, gizzard and legs) and 19 strains from environmental samples (water, ice, and equipment surfaces). The detection analyses were performed using conventional microbiological techniques, biochemical tests, serological and agar diffusion methods for antimicrobial susceptibility. The results showed a high resistance to Na (73.3%; 107/146), Nf (60.2%; 88/147), T (56.2%; 82/146), O (54.8%; 80/146), Tr (54.1%; 79/146) and low resistance to Ex (6.2%; 9/146), Cf (2.7%; 4/146), N (2.0%; 3/146) and C (2.7%; 4/146). There was observed a high percentage of multiresistant strains (65.0%; 95/146) and within of them, the most common patterns were: NaNfTTr (42.1%), NaNfTr (26.3%) and NaNfT (10.5%). No significant relationship was observed (P>0.05) between resistance and multiresistance patterns with the source of the Salmonella strains. These results are evidence of the emergence of resistant Salmonella strains to fluoroquinolones and the necessity of programs for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica in retail produce environments and to elucidate possible ecological niches. Thirty environmental samples per store were collected during daily operations monthly for six months in 30 retail produce departments across seven states. Selected samples were serially diluted and plated to determine aerobic plate count. Each sample was tested for L. monocytogenes and S. enterica using ROKA Atlas LmG2 and SEN assays, respectively. A total of 5,112 samples were tested for each pathogen. S. enterica was found during one sampling event in a single store; less than 0.1% of samples were positive overall. A total of 4.4% environmental samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was present on 8.1% of non-food contact surfaces and 1.6% of food contact surfaces tested; L. monocytogenes prevalence was highly variable among stores. Most of the positive L. monocytogenes samples were found in drains, floors, squeegees, or standing water. Genetically similar L. monocytogenes clones were found in multiple stores across multiple states. The odds of detecting L. monocytogenes increased 1.8-fold for every 1-log increase in APC (p < 0.0001). This is the first study to investigate prevalence and persistence of L. monocytogenes and S. enterica in retail produce environments. Our data suggest that some, but not all retail produce environments have high L. monocytogenes prevalence, which may cross-contaminate produce. Sites heavily contaminated with L. monocytogenes indicate potential targets for sanitation operating procedures and food safety management strategies. However, S. enterica prevalence is very low and likely due to transient contamination. Further, APC may be a cost-effective environmental monitoring tool that could indicate an environment capable of harboring L. monocytogenes..",

		"abstract": "Introduction. Supermarkets microbiological assessments are typically performed on food, and little information is available about carts and baskets used for grocery shopping. Studies on shopping carts contamination express concerns mostly associated with infants' exposure to pathogens; however, there is the potential of food contamination due to carts and baskets. Purpose. To identify the microbial contamination present in supermarkets shopping carts and baskets. Methods. A total of 97 samples were collected from 21 supermarkets at eight different towns located in West Texas. Shopping cart handles, shopping cart grills, and grocery baskets were sampled using 25 ml BPW swabs. Microbial analyses were performed to enumerate aerobic plate count (APC), yeast and molds (YM), Enterobacteriaceae (EB), coliforms (CF), and Escherichia coli (EC). The prevalence of Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and E. coli O157 was determined. Petrifilm, BAX system, and conventional selective agar media were used for the analyses. Results. APC, EB, CF, and EC were at higher levels on handles (2.45, 4.43, 6.43, and 1.44 log CFU/cm2, respectively), followed by baskets (2.03, 3.67, 5.55, and 0.7 log CFU/cm2, respectively). YM was highest on baskets (3.01 log CFU/cm2). Cart grills had less than 10 CFU/cm2 of APC, YM, CF and EC, but 2.38 log CFU/cm2 of EB. The overall prevalence for the three type of samples was found to be: Salmonella 7.2%, E. coli O157 6.2%, S. aureus 61.8%, Listeria spp. 76.3%, (8.5% confirmed L. monocytogenes), and Enterobacteriaceae 51.5%. Significance. Bacterial contamination of shopping carts and grocery baskets should be treated as a major public health threat. Fruits and vegetables are often placed on carts and baskets without protection; similarly, meat and other foodstuffs are wrapped in bags not properly sealed during grocery shopping. The presence of foodborne pathogens on such surfaces pose a risk of food contamination and a potential cause of illness.",

		"abstract": "Aims. In order to investigate Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella contamination, a survey was conducted at three peanut confectionery processing companies (A, B and C) in Brazil. Methods and results. Samples of different peanut confectionery products (n = 59), peanut raw material (n = 30), manufacturing environment (n = 116) and workers' hand surfaces (n = 12) were analysed. Salmonella and E. coli were not detected in any final product or raw material analysed. Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from 15% of final products. Coliforms were detected in only one sample. Referring to the raw material, six samples showed contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and three samples by coliforms. For the process environment, 19% and 11% of samples presented Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms. Escherichia coli was detected in 5% of samples, and one of these samples tested positive for Salmonella; this strain was serotyping as S. Heidelberg. All food handlers surveyed in Company C showed Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms on their hands. Escherichia coli was isolated from one food worker's hand. Conclusions. The results showed that the manufacturing environment, including food handlers were considered the main sources for possible contamination of peanut confectionery products. Significance and Impact of the Study. This has been the first study to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae throughout peanut confectionery processing lines. The results might be used to assist risk assessment studies and to establish more effective control measures. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.",

Previously, neither abattoir had food safety programs in place nor were they subjected to strict food safety regulatory surveillance. Abattoirs A and B were sampled on 4 nonconsecutive months each. Swab samples of abattoir A (n = 160, 40 samples per sampling date) and abattoir B (n = 78, 16-22 samples per sampling date) were taken from direct and indirect food contact surfaces, screened by BAX real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and confirmed using immunomagnetic separation, selective media, and latex agglutination. In abattoir A, Salmonella presence was negligible, whereas presumptive STECs were present in 10%, 12.5%, 0%, and 5% of the environmental samples respective to each sampling month, indicating a reduction of STEC (P = .06) by the third and fourth sampling months. Conversely, presumptive STEC presence was negligible in abattoir B, whereas Salmonella presence for each sampling month was of 5.6%, 6.3%, 27.3%, and 0.0%, respectively. Upon the increased pathogen presence detected on the third sampling month, additional actions were taken to reinforce the implementation of food safety practices and programs, which resulted in a Salmonella reduction to 0% by the fourth sampling month (P = .013). The satisfactory results strongly suggest that a multiple-intervention approach is crucial to improve food safety in this type of premises.",

		"abstract": "ObjectivesTo evaluate reduction of STEC and Salmonella in 2 small beef processing plants in Honduras after training and implementation of SSOP and GMP. Materials and MethodsChanges in pathogen presence were monitored in 2 small Honduran beef processing plants. Plants processed 140 and 25 heads of cattle per week. Initially, neither plant had food safety programs in place. Swab samples of plant A (n = 160) and plant B (n = 78) were taken from direct and indirect food contact surfaces on January, May, June and July for plant A and January, March, June, and July for plant B. After each sampling month, SSOP for equipment and surfaces with positive pathogen presence were provided to the plants. Additionally, employees underwent comprehensive SSOP, GMP and HACCP training. Swab samples were analyzed by BAX RT Salmonella and STEC screening and confirmed using immunomagnetic separation, selective media and latex agglutination. Fisher’s exact tests for equality of proportions were used in R (v3.4.4) statistical package to compare pathogen presence among sampling months. ResultsIn Plant A, STEC occurred in 10, 12.5, 0, and 5% of the environmental samples respective to each month, indicating a significant reduction of STEC (p < 0.10) by the third sampling month. This coincided with the completion of GMP, SSOP and HACCP training, providing customized GMP manuals, and the use of SSOP for disinfection of targeted equipment, surfaces, and utensils found with positive pathogen presence in previous sampling dates. In plant A, after implementation of SSOPs for targeted positive sampling areas, samples were not positive in subsequent sampling months, indicating effectiveness of recommended SSOPs. In Plant A, Salmonella environmental presence was at 0% except at one sampling interval and thus was not adequate to validate effective implementation of interventions. Salmonella environmental presence for each month in Plant B was of 5.6, 6.3, 27.3, and 0.0%, respectively. In plant B, persistence of Salmonella was observed in the stuffer, where confirmed Salmonella isolates were found in January and March. After second positive sample was found, in-plant training of stuffer SSOP was made, resulting in absence of Salmonella in the stuffer in June. The highest Salmonella presence was observed by the fourth sampling month. Therefore, additional actions were taken to reinforce implementation of SSOP and GMP manual instructions, and verification procedures, which collectively resulted in a Salmonella reduction to 0% (p < 0.10) by the fourth sampling month. STEC presence in this plant was too low to be an indication of validation of the effectiveness of implementation of interventions. ConclusionThese experiences demonstrate the feasibility of fully implementing SSOP with verification procedures and compliance with the instructions of a customized GMP manual. Trained employees are more involved in cleaning and disinfection procedures before and after processing. In addition, evisceration and other dressing procedures are performed with more caution. In summary, the ongoing training of plant personnel increases awareness of food safety. Consequently, the presence of STEC and Salmonella can be significantly reduced in this type of facility.",

Samples collected from external surfaces of cantaloupes, water, and the environments of packing sheds on cantaloupe farms were examined for the presence of Salmonella and E. coli. Of a total of 1,735 samples collected, 31 (1.8%) tested positive for Salmonella. Fifteen Salmonella serotypes were isolated from samples collected in Texas, and nine from samples collected in Colima. Two serotypes (Poona and Oranienburg) that have been associated with three large Salmonella outbreaks in the United States and Canada linked to the consumption of contaminated cantaloupe were found in water samples collected at four farms (three from the United States). Susceptibility of Salmonella isolates to 10 antimicrobials was evaluated by disk diffusion. Eighty-eight percent of the isolates from the United States and Mexico were pansusceptible to the antimicrobials tested; eight isolates from the United States demonstrated an intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin and only two isolates were resistant to the same antimicrobial. From Mexico, four isolates showed an intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin and one isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid and streptomycin. Repetitive sequence-based PCR analysis of Salmonella isolates helped to trace potential sources of Salmonella contamination in source water and in subsequent water samples obtained after the filtration systems of U.S. and Mexican cantaloupe farms. No differences could be seen between the levels of Salmonella contamination in melons from both countries.",

An investigation was conducted to identify a source and contain the outbreak. Methods: The cluster was initially identified through routine geographic information system cluster scanning applied to the New South Wales Notifiable Conditions Management System. Additional cases were identified through a complaint to local council about a bakery. The bakery was inspected and 48 environmental and food swabs were collected for analysis. Results: A total of 26 suspected cases were identified, of which 14 were interviewed. STm MLVA type 3-16-9-11-523 was identified in 19 of 26 case stool specimens. Most cases (12/14) consumed bread rolls containing pork or chicken with chicken liver pate and raw egg mayonnaise filling. Five cases identified a common bakery exposure. Environmental and food samples from the bakery isolated STm with an identical MLVA pattern. Discussion: An STm cluster in SWS was investigated and found to be linked to Vietnamese bread rolls containing pork or chicken with chicken liver pate and raw egg mayonnaise filling. Confirmation of a distinct MLVA pattern among STm isolates from clinical, food and environmental samples provided evidence to establish an epidemiological link between the cases and the implicated premises and informed public health action to contain the outbreak.",

		"abstract": "Introduction. Microbial communities in food processing plants can potentially serve as indicators of food quality and safety. Hence, it is vital to understand the microbial communities in the food processing environment and how they overlap and contaminate the final product. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are overlaps between the microbial communities of the processing environment and the microbial communities of the product at different stages of processing, starting from the raw materials to the finished product. Methods. The study was conducted in a fluid milk processing plant in the Midwest region of the United States, which is capable of producing 6,000 gallons of fluid milk per day. Samples consisted of fluid milk during various stages of processing and from the plant environment. Genomic DNA was isolated from all the samples and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to study the bacterial population in the complex microbiome. Results. The microbiota of the raw milk and the processing environment were complex in contrast to the pasteurized and the final packed milk. Genera such as Paenibacillus, Viribacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Carnobacterium that can cause product spoilage in cold-stored products were found at higher relative abundances in the production environment, product contact surfaces, and in the final packed product. The raw product carried Listeria and Salmonella, which were eliminated by pasteurization. The microbial communities in the product were distinctly different from those in the processing environment. The processing environment had indigenous and product-related microbial communities. Product contact surfaces and final product had overlapping microbial communities. Significance. Facility microbiome surveillance activities provide a valuable approach to help monitor the food processing facility and product microbial communities. These measures can support improved strategies in zoning decisions.",

		"abstract": "In microbiological surveys, false negative results in detection tests precluding the enumeration by MPN may occur. The objective of this study was to illustrate the impact of screening test failure on the probability distribution of Salmonella concentrations in pork using a Bayesian method. A total of 276 swab samples in four slaughter steps (69 samples in each slaughter step: after dehairing, after singeing, after evisceration, and before chilling) were screened for Salmonella and enumerated by the MPN method. Salmonella contamination data were fitted to a lognormal distribution by using a Bayesian model that uses the number of positive tubes at each dilution in an MPN analysis to estimate the parameters of the concentration distribution. With Salmonella paired data, three data sets were used for each slaughter step: one that includes the positives in the screening test only, a second one that includes false negative results from the screening, and a third that considers the entire data set. The relative sensitivity of the screening test was also calculated assuming as gold standard samples with confirmed Salmonella. Salmonella was confirmed by a reference laboratory in 29 samples either by screening or MPN method. The relative sensitivity of the screening test was 69% (CI 95%: 52%-85%). The data set that included enumerations from screen-negative samples (false negative results) tended to have higher and smaller sigma in comparison with the data set that discards false negative results, suggesting that the lack of sensitivity of the screening test affects the distribution that describes the contamination across the population. Numerous surveys on fitting distribution methods of microbial censored data have been published and discuss source of bias due to fitting method. Results of this survey contribute with that discussion by illustrating another possible source of bias due to failure of the screening methods preceding the MPN.",

In this study, we performed a three-stage evaluation: (I) comprehensive evaluation, (II) implementation of improvement actions and (III) verification of the success of the actions implemented in three abattoirs from Argentina during 2016-2018. Risk was estimated using two checklists, quantified on a 1-100 scale and classified as high (1-40), moderate (41-70) and low (71-100). In stages I and III, Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC were detected and isolated in samples from carcasses (n = 252), the environment (n = 252); head meat (n = 21) and viscera washing and chilling water (n = 105). Carcass samples were analyzed for mesophilic aerobic organisms, coliforms and E. coli enumeration. Of 201 water samples taken, 42.0-75.6% were non-potable quality. After the implementation of improvement actions in stage II (building, processes, systems for water purification and training), the estimation of risk of contamination was reduced from high to moderate in all three abattoirs, the count of indicator microorganisms decreased in two abattoirs, and the presence of pathogens significantly decreased. Salmonella spp. was not isolated from any of the samples collected in two abattoirs. Isolation of E. coli O157:H7 decreased in carcass and was not isolated from viscera washing and chilling water. Isolation of non-O157 STEC decreased in carcass but not in environmental samples. Finally, 75.0-95.0% of water samples were of potable quality. Although this was only the first step in the process of change and improvement of abattoirs, the assessment of the situation and the proposal of solutions to correct deviations in a joint effort with the health authorities helped to implement a work model for enhancing food safety before meat reaches consumers.",

		"abstract": "More than 100 foodborne salmonellosis outbreaks occur each year in the United States. Contaminated food preparation equipment is implicated in approximately 32% of Salmonella outbreaks with a known source. In April 2009, we investigated reported Salmonella infections at a camp in New Hampshire. Camp attendees were contacted to complete a standard questionnaire. The questionnaire asked about foods eaten while at the camp, symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, visits to healthcare providers, and specimen submission for pathogen testing. Laboratory and environmental investigations were conducted, including testing of foods and food preparation equipment. A total of 133 ill persons, including 47 laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Enteritidis infections, were identified during this investigation. A total of 142 (80%) of 178 camp attendees completed a standard questionnaire and 109 cases of gastrointestinal illness and 33 healthy individuals were identified. Statistical analysis of survey data indicated that people who ate pudding were 15 times more likely to become ill with salmonellosis than those who did not eat pudding (risk ratio, 15.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-102.3). Salmonella Enteritidis was identified in leftover pudding and in the internal mixing components of the blender used to mix the pudding. All patient, food, and blender isolates exhibited the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. This outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis was caused by a Salmonella-contaminated hand-held immersion blender used to prepare pudding at a camp. A malfunctioning blender shaft seal is suspected to have resulted in contamination of the blender and subsequently pudding prepared using the blender.",

		"abstract": "Interviews were conducted with the owners of three organic lettuce farms in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil using a standardized self-assessment questionnaire to ascertain the status of implementation of good agricultural practices and management systems in place. In addition, on each farm 132 samples (manure, field soil, water, workers' hands and equipment, lettuce seedlings, and crops) were collected during four visits throughout the lettuce crop production cycle and subjected to analysis for hygiene indicators (Escherichia coli, coliforms) and presence of Salmonella and E.Â coli O157. E.Â coli O157 was detected twice (in irrigation water and in rinse water) out of 27 analyzed water samples. Salmonella spp. was detected in one out of nine manure samples applied as organic fertilizer. In addition, generic E.Â coli was frequently present in numbers exceeding 10Â cfu/g in manure, manured soil, and lettuce samples or more than 1Â cfu/100Â ml in water. No E.Â coli O157 was detected in any of the lettuce samples (nÂ =Â 36), but Salmonella spp. was detected once in lettuce taken during the crop cycle 2 weeks before harvest. It was demonstrated that the combination of the self-assessment questionnaire and microbiological sampling and analysis could identify weak points in current organic farming practices in this region of southern Brazil. It was noted that manure composting was not adequately controlled and appropriate waiting times before application as an organic fertilizer to crop were not respected. Also the selection of the water source and the sanitary quality of the water used for irrigation were not under control. The washing step (with sanitizer) of lettuce crops at harvest, generally considered a potential reduction step for microbial contamination, was often not verified for its efficiency. This may detract from the sanitary quality of the produce and are risk factors for the introduction of pathogens in the lettuce sent to market. The study, combining interviews, sampling, and analysis, contributed to increasing the farmers' awareness of enteric pathogens as a food safety issue in leafy greens. Further communication and training on good agricultural practices are recommended to remediate the weak points identified in the current management system.",

Methodology and Results: This study was conducted using a semi-structured survey, coupled with sampling throughout the smoking process monitoring and microbiological analysis. Total flora, coliforms, Anaerobic Sulfito-reducers, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yeast and Mould and Salmonella spp. are the main microorganisms that are isolated in the analyzed fish. The results revealed major deficiencies in hygiene during the process. Microbial contamination obtained during processing step was significantly different, with higher contamination after smoking and sale. The microbiological quality of most fish analyzed was not satisfactory, with the presence of yeasts and molds (76.7%), Anaerobic Sulfito-reducers (56.7%), fecal coliforms (33.3%) and Escherichia coli (26.7%). However, potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were not detected in any of the samples analyzed. Conclusion and Application: More attention aim at reducing the microbial contamination of smoked fish should be paid to this sector. The strict application of hygiene throughout the smoking process and the sale would significantly reduce the contamination of fish by improving their storage.",

Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 32 poultry farms and five slaughterhouses in the province of Skikda (northeastern Algeria). A questionnaire was answered by the poultry farmers and slaughterhouses' managers. Biological samples (cloacal swabs, droppings, caeca, livers, and neck skins) and environmental ones (water, feed, surface wipes, rinsing water, and sticking knife swabbing) were taken to assess the Salmonella contamination status. Results: Nearly 34.37% of the poultry farms and all the slaughterhouses were contaminated with Salmonella. The isolated Salmonella strains belonged to two major serotypes: Kentucky and Heidelberg followed by Enteritidis, Virginia, and Newport. There was an evident heterogeneous distribution of serotypes in poultry farms and slaughterhouses. Only one factor (earth floor) was significantly associated with Salmonella contamination in poultry houses (p<0.05). Conclusion: A high prevalence rate of Salmonella contamination was found in poultry farms and slaughterhouses in Skikda region. These results showed the foremost hazardous role of poultry production in the spread and persistence of Salmonella contamination in the studied region.",

In the U.S. poultry industry, performance standards have been in place to measure the prevalence of Salmonella. Over time, the performance standards have changed to reflect the improved conditions in the industry. Prevalence based performance standards may work for other product categories, especially in dry products of raw agricultural products such as wheat flours and the produce area, especially for frozen fruits and vegetables.

The outbreak was characterized by a low level intermittent infection with Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 over a 19-day period. The epidemiology did not suggest a common source for the outbreak and there was little evidence for person-to-person spread. Extensive food and environmental sampling failed to yield salmonella. Control measures within the kitchens and on wards early in the outbreak had no effect on the rate of infection. Faecal screening of asymptomatic people demonstrated a high carriage rate among catering staff (12.3%), compared with ward staff (2.2%) or patients (0.8%). A case-control study failed to reveal any association between illness and particular meals, food types, wards, medical attendants, medical procedures, or medication. However there was an association between illness and eating meals prepared by one carrier (P=0.02). Transmission was believed to be via intermittent contamination of occasional meals. No further cases occurred after the exclusion of infected food handlers. The identifiable costs of the outbreak amounted to approximately pnd 33,000. These results indicate that asymptomatic food handlers may be the source of nosocomial salmonella outbreaks, and that efforts should be made to identify carriers and treat them.",

		"abstract": "Peaches are popular, nutritious and widely consumed. Being a tree crop, it is considered a low risk fruit, with no direct water contact, and no previous foodborne disease outbreaks associated with its consumption. However, in 2014 the pioneer association between stone fruit and a foodborne illness was reported, linking Listeria monocytogenes to stone fruit. This highlights the need for better understanding of risk associated with contaminated fresh stone fruit, in order to implement adequate preventative measures. No information is available on the presence of foodborne pathogens on peaches in the supply chain. A case study approach was therefore followed to assess foodborne pathogen presence on the farm, focusing on the impact of irrigation water, facility sanitation and hygiene by collecting various fruit and environmental samples (n=428). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating basic microbial testing with safety management and risk assessment tools that can be collectively used to improve the food safety management system. No Salmonella Typhimurium was detected from samples, however, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected on fruit and environmental samples. Despite the GlobalG.A.P. certification status of the farm, livestock frequented water sources which lead to E. coli O157:H7 contamination. This conclusion was based on positive detection of foodborne pathogens from the water sources and subsequent removal of livestock which resulted in a definite decrease in pathogen detection. A number of E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus were detected during the second year of monitoring from environmental samples and it was observed that the personal hygiene and facility sanitation was not adequately enforced. Based on feedback given to the farmer, enforcement was improved and a definite decrease in foodborne pathogens was observed in the following sampling cycle. Areas of risk that were still identified following the fourth year of monitoring included the water source used for irrigation and poor sanitation in the production and processing facilities. Limited foodborne pathogen prevalence on peaches over the full study period as well as the extended export supply chain at controlled temperatures resulted in low-to-medium calculated consumer risk. The correct and meticulous implementation of integrated and holistic pre- and post-harvest food safety management systems is therefore essential to prevent produce contamination, reduce the consumer risk and therefore ensure overall product safety.",

		"abstract": "Processors increasingly rely on microbiological sampling of the plant environment to determine if their products or processes are at risk of containing or transmitting pathogens. Sampling and analytical tests may be conducted for specific pathogens such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes. Aerobic plate counts and ATP bioluminescence assays are often used to identify areas that need additional cleaning and sanitation. Frequently, food processors react to unacceptable test results through additional sampling or sanitation procedures. However, continual, long-term evaluation of environmental sampling plans and test results should be performed to determine if there are trends in microbial detection. The evaluation of the sampling plan and the test data over extended times may lead to changes in the test sample frequency, location and analysis performed, or in the plant's corrective actions. A spreadsheet template was developed to aid these evaluations. The template provides a format for recording sample collection day, date, shift, hour, sample location, analytical test (qualitative or quantitative) and test result. A data set of 2000 samples was constructed and analysed using the \"PivotTable\" feature in Microsoft Excel. This feature creates an interactive data table that quickly summarizes large data sets or subsets.",

In that context, the recent FSMA Proposed Rule for Preventive Controls for Animal Food will soon put increasing pressure on the industry to demonstrate that systems and processes are in place for prevention and control of potential microbial hazards. Although the pet food industry already is implementing protocols and practices for ensuring product safety, the vast majority of food safety research being published and presented at conferences (including IAFP Annual Meetings) addresses processing of human foods, with little attention to special challenges associated with pet and animal foods. These include delivering a complete nutritional profile in a single product, managing animal-derived ingredients in a low-moisture manufacturing environment, preventing cross-contamination, and selecting and validating optimal critical controls. Consequently, this symposium will focus on the scientific, technical, and practical aspects of implementing such systems. The speakers will review current knowledge and the state-of-practice related to cGMPs and pathogen reduction, present new data on a novel application of competitive microflora in pet food manufacturing facilities, and end with a case study on pathogen reduction in pet food products. Attendees will gain a practical understanding of the fundamentals and challenges associated with implementing pathogen controls in pet food manufacturing systems.",

		"abstract": "There has been a continuous rise in the number of produce-based foodborne outbreaks in the recent decades despite the perception that foodborne diseases were primarily linked to animal-based products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 95% of Salmonella-based infections originate from foodborne sources, with multiple produce-based salmonellosis outbreaks occurring since 1990. The contamination of produce in both the pre-harvest and post-harvest produce environments is challenging to eliminate since produce is consumed as a raw, fresh commodity. Salmonella spp contamination is possible through contact with the produce in the field as well as in the processing facility. The field contamination of produce infers the ability of Salmonella spp to survive on the plant surface. The fitness of Salmonella spp in the plant habitat is limited as opposed to naturally plant-associated bacteria, but survival is possible. The use of intensive farming practices, globalization of food products, high demand for convenience food products, and increased foodborne disease surveillance also have unknown ramifications in the ascending trends of produce-based outbreaks. A better understanding of the ecology of Salmonella spp in the plant environment as well as the processing, food handling and surveillance factors affecting the incidence of foodborne outbreaks will provide a comprehensive view of the etiology and epidemiology of produce-associated foodborne outbreaks. An understanding of the outbreaks and the factors facilitating produce contamination will allow for the development of intervention procedures and strategies to reduce the risk of produce contamination by Salmonella spp.",

Fourteen kiwifruit orchards and two processing plants in Shaanxi province were visited for sampling in 2012. Fruit samples and environmental samples in orchards and plants were taken for isolation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. All isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and detection of virulence genes. Selected isolates were further examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. In total, 160 E. coli isolates and 14 S. aureus isolates were recovered from 407 samples from orchards and plants, while no Salmonella was recovered. E. coli isolates displayed resistance most frequently to streptomycin (65.6%), and S. aureus isolates displayed resistance most frequently to erythromycin (21.4%). Three E. coli isolates (1.9%) were positive for stx2 and two S. aureus isolates (14.3%) were positive for both seb and seh. Seventy-seven E. coli isolates and 14 S. aureus isolates were analyzed by PFGE. PFGE results showed that both E. coli and S. aureus isolates were diverse, and blades for slicing during the processing could be an important contamination source. This study could provide useful information for kiwifruit growers and industry to establish proper management practices that help minimize the chance of microbial contamination from farm to table.",

The objectives were to identify the Critical Control Points (CCP) and Control Points (CP) in the pasteurized milk and strawberry yogurt processing chain; to evaluate the microbiological quality of the products, as well as the contamination index of the processing surfaces of a dairy industry located in the municipality of Tucurui, Para. Regarding the GMP evaluation, it was used the Collegiate Board Resolution 275 verification sheet. The steps of the flowcharts of the dairy products manufacturing chain were evaluated in order to identify PCCs and PCs and potential health hazards to the consumers. The microbiological analysis of the dairy products (total and thermo-tolerant coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus counts and Salmonella research) followed the official methods of the American Public Health Association. Also, swab of 12 surfaces involved in the processing chain of the products were submitted to the same microbiological analysis. Based on the degree of compliance with GMP, the dairy industry was placed within the Group 1 category. The results of microbiological analysis in pasteurized milk and yoghurt were found to comply with the legal requirements. However, although the surfaces were in accordance with the specifications for thermo-tolerant coliforms, a high contamination rate with Staphylococcus aureus and total coliforms were found, which indicates hygienic-sanitary failure in the dairy industry.",

Many of the reported food-borne outbreaks associated with low-moisture foods involve Salmonella contamination. The control of Salmonella in low-moisture foods and their production environments represents a significant challenge for all food manufacturers. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge with respect to Salmonella survival in intermediate- and low-moisture food matrices and their production environments. The mechanisms utilized by this bacterium to ensure their survival in these dry conditions remain to be fully elucidated, however, in depth transcriptomic data is now beginning to emerge regarding this observation. Earlier research work described the effect(s) that low-moisture can exert on the long-term persistence and heat tolerance of Salmonella, however, data are also now available highlighting the potential cross-tolerance to other stressors including commonly used microbicidal agents. Sources and potential control measures to reduce the risk of contamination will be explored. By extending our understanding of these geno- and phenotypes, we may be able to exploit them to improve food safety and protect public health.",

We report on seven outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) 03-26-13-08-523 (European convention 2-24-12-7-0212) in three Australian states and territories investigated between November 2015 and March 2016. We identified a common egg grading facility in five of the outbreaks. While no Salmonella Typhimurium was detected at the grading facility and eggs could not be traced back to a particular farm, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates from cases from all seven outbreaks indicated a common source. WGS was able to provide higher discriminatory power than MLVA and will likely link more Salmonella Typhimurium cases between states and territories in the future. National harmonization of Salmonella surveillance is important for effective implementation of WGS for Salmonella outbreak investigations.",

Six serotypes of the Salmonella genus are mentioned in the Belgian and European regulation as to be rapidly excluded from the food chain (EU regulation N°2160/2003, Belgian royal decree 27/04/2017). The reference method for Salmonella serotyping, including slide-agglutination and biochemical tests, is time-consuming, expensive, not always objective, and therefore does not match the fast identification criteria required by the legislation. In this study, a molecular method, using genetic markers detected by Multiplex Oligonucleotide Ligation – PCR and Luminex technology, was developed for the identification of the 6 Salmonella serotypes and their variants subjected to an official control. The resulting method was validated with the analysis of 971 Salmonella isolated from different matrixes (human, animal, food or environment) and 33 non-Salmonella strains. The results were compared with the reference identifications, achieving an accuracy of 99.7%. The cost-effective high-throughput genoserotyping assay is performed in 1 day and generates objective results, thanks to the automatic interpretation of raw data using a barcode system. In conclusion, it is fully adapted to the implementation in first line laboratories and meets the requirements of the regulation.",

Methods: To verify the effectiveness of training provided to NRC staff, proficiency test samples consisting of ground beef inoculated with salmonellae and E. coli O157:H7 were prepared by the Proficiency Testing Unit of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and shipped to the NRC for analysis. The NRC laboratory demonstrated 100% accuracy in the identification of the target pathogens in all samples, demonstrating the successful implementation of on-site test capability. For the prevalence study, a total of 129 samples from arctic mammals, fowl, fish and environmental swabs from community freezers were analyzed at both the NRC and CFIA laboratories. Results: No E. coli O157- or Salmonella-positives were identified for any of the samples examined. Conclusion: These results represent a first step towards the creation for future reference of a database on the prevalence of the pathogens E. coli O157 and Salmonella.",

Aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts and Pseudomonas counts were performed by standard procedures and the prevalence of Listeria, presumptive Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus determined. Statistically significant (P lt 0.05) increases in counts of all types of bacteria were obtained on product samples as a result of processing. Although bacterial counts on neck skin samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.4 log CFU g-1 after spray washing of carcasses, subsequent spinchilling and packaging of whole carcasses resulted in 0.7 to 1.2 log CFU g-1 increases. Bacterial numbers on equipment surfaces, however, decreased significantly from the \"dirty\" to the \"clean\" areas of the abattoir. Transport cages, \"rubber fingers\", defeathering curtains, shackles and conveyor belts repeatedly showed aerobic plate counts in excess of 5.0 log CFU 25 cm-2. Aerobic plate counts of scald tank and spin chiller water were 2 log CFU ml-1 higher than those of potable water samples. Bacterial numbers of the air in the \"dirty\" area were higher than those of the \"clean\" area. Listeria, presumptive Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from 27.6, 51.7 and 24.1% of all product samples, respectively, and Listeria and Staphylococcus aureus were also isolated from selected equipment surfaces.",

		"abstract": "Results of the Belgian meat surveillance programme conducted during 1998-2001 are discussed. Various meat types were sampled from a wide range of processing establishments in Belgium. Up to 2000, surveillance focused on the prevalence of Escherichiacoli in samples, while in 2001 Enterobacteriaceae levels and total plate counts were assessed. Prevalence of pathogens in beef and pork samples was directly related to E.coli levels in the processing environment. In poultry meat, Salmonella and Campylobacter were principal indicators of contamination. It is concluded that E.coli assessment using Bio-Rad medium and total plate counts are the best microbiological techniques for evaluating hygiene levels in the meat industry, especially in abbatoirs.

		"abstract": "Importance. This large outbreak of foodborne salmonellosis demonstrated the complexity of investigating outbreaks linked to poultry products. The outbreak also highlighted the importance of efforts to strengthen food safety policies related to Salmonella in chicken parts and has implications for future changes within the poultry industry. Objective. To investigate a large multistate outbreak of multidrug resistant Salmonella Heidelberg infections. Design. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of patients infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella Heidelberg and traceback of possible food exposures. Setting. United States. Outbreak period was March 1, 2013 through July 11, 2014 Patients. A case was defined as illness in a person infected with a laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Heidelberg with 1 of 7 outbreak pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) XbaI patterns with illness onset from March 1, 2013 through July 11, 2014. A total of 634 case-patients were identified through passive surveillance; 200/528 (38%) were hospitalized, none died. Results. Interviews were conducted with 435 case-patients: 371 (85%) reported eating any chicken in the 7 days before becoming ill. Of 273 case-patients interviewed with a focused questionnaire, 201 (74%) reported eating chicken prepared at home. Among case-patients with available brand information, 152 (87%) of 175 patients reported consuming Company A brand chicken. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was completed on 69 clinical isolates collected from case-patients; 67% were drug resistant, including 24 isolates (35%) that were multidrug resistant. The source of Company A brand chicken consumed by case-patients was traced back to 3 California production establishments from which 6 of 7 outbreak strains were isolated. Conclusions. Epidemiologic, laboratory, traceback, and environmental investigations conducted by local, state, and federal public health and regulatory officials indicated that consumption of Company A chicken was the cause of this outbreak. The outbreak involved multiple PFGE patterns, a variety of chicken products, and 3 production establishments, suggesting a reservoir for contamination upstream from the production establishments. Sources of bacteria and genes responsible for resistance, such as farms providing birds for slaughter or environmental reservoir on farms that raise chickens, might explain how multiple PFGE patterns were linked to chicken from 3 separate production establishments and many different poultry products.",

We identified 272 cases in 44 states with illness onset dates ranging from 1 July 2009 to 14 April 2010. To help generate hypotheses, warehouse store membership card information was collected to identify products consumed by cases. These records identified 19 ill persons who purchased company A salami products before onset of illness. A case-control study was conducted. Ready-to-eat salami consumption was significantly associated with illness (matched odds ratio 8.5, 95% confidence interval 2.1-75.9). The outbreak strain was isolated from company A salami products from an environmental sample from one manufacturing plant, and sealed containers of black and red pepper at the facility. This outbreak illustrates the importance of using membership card information to assist in identifying suspect vehicles, the potential for spices to contaminate ready-to-eat products, and preventing raw ingredient contamination of these products.",

These controls were aimed to verify the hygienic conditions of the manufacturing process. The samples collected were analyzed for Salmonella spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. The count of Enterobacteriaceae was always below the limits of acceptability. Indeed, Salmonella was isolated from 28% of pig carcasses and from 17% of sheep carcasses. Environmental samples resulted always negative. Salmonella strains isolated were subjected to serotyping, phage-typing and molecular sub-typing by PFGE. Based on our data, it could be attributed the presence of Salmonella spp. to the poor health status of animals or to the persistence of Salmonella in leirage.",

		"abstract": "Increases in foodborne disease outbreaks associated with fresh produce have necessitated the need to identify potential sources of microbial contamination in produce and agricultural environments. The present study evaluated Salmonella prevalence and serovar diversity in fruit (225), water (140) and surface (126) samples, from three commercial farms and associated packhouses, located in different farming regions in South Africa. Fruit and water samples were collected from both orchards and packhouses, while surface samples were collected from conveyer belts and hands of packhouse employees. Salmonella was detected in 26 of the 491 (5.3%) samples. Environmental samples (water and surfaces) recorded a slightly higher proportion (3.1%; 15/491) of positive samples compared to fruit samples (2.2%; 11/491). Salmonella was not detected on employee hands and river water samples. A total of 263 Salmonella isolates were obtained from the 26 positive samples by standard culture methods, preliminarily identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) and API 20E, and confirmed by invA gene. Of the 39 representative isolates serotyped the serovars Muenchen (33.3%), Typhimurium (30.8%), Heidelberg (20.5%), Bsilla (7.7%), Salmonella subspecies IIb: 17: r: z (5.1%) and one untypable strain were identified. Most samples had multiple serovars with orchard water form one site recording the highest serovar diversity (4 serovars). Our findings show the potential of agricultural fruit production environments to act as reservoirs of clinically important Salmonella serovars.",

		"abstract": "A microbiological investigation on Salmonella contamination was conducted in two U.S. rendering plants to investigate the potential cross-contamination of Salmonella in the rendering processing environment. Sampling locations were predetermined at the areas where Salmonella contamination may potentially occur, including raw materials receiving, crax (rendered materials before grinding process) grinding, and finished meal loading-out areas. Salmonella was either enumerated directly on xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar plates or enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed using CHROMagar plating and latex agglutination testing and then characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and biofilm-forming determination. Among 108 samples analyzed, 79 (73%) samples were Salmonella positive after enrichment. Selected Salmonella isolates (n = 65) were assigned to 31 unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, with 16 Salmonella serotypes, including Typhimurium and Mbandaka, identified as predominant serotypes and 10 Salmonella strains determined as strong biofilm formers. Our results indicated that the raw materials receiving area was the primary source of Salmonella and that the surfaces surrounding crax grinding and finished meal loading-out areas harbor Salmonella in biofilms that may recontaminate the finished meals. The same Salmonella serotypes found in both raw materials receiving and the finished meal loading-out areas suggested a potential of cross-contamination between different areas in the rendering processing environment.",

		"abstract": "In this study four meat retail systems (large supermarkets, discount supermarkets, traditional butcheries and street markets) have been examined in order to gather information on the safety and hygiene conditions of facilities, food processing and selling practices. A total of 32 inspections were conducted both in the morning and in the afternoon. A total of 11 samples of meat in the production process, 31 of retail meat, 32 of superficial swabs (n=110 from surfaces in contact with meat and n=32 from surfaces not in contact with meat), and 104 of environmental air were taken. High values of total microbial count (105-106 cfu/g) were detected in all the retail systems for meat in production, retail meat, and working surfaces; low values of total microbial count were found only in samples from cold norms (102ufc/g). Salmonella spp. was detected only in one sample of pork meat collected in one butchery. On the contrary, Listeria monocytogenes was detected in 50% of retail meat samples (from supermarkets), 50% of samples of meat in production (from discount supermarkets), and 50% and 63% of samples of meat in production and ready to be sold, respectively (from street markets). This microorganism was also detected on working surfaces: 16% of samples from discount supermarkets, 25% from supermarkets and 62% from street vendors were positive. On the other hand, L. monocytogenes was never recovered from samples collected at butchers' shops. In conclusion these results point out that the hygiene and safety levels of meat sold in large scale retail systems need to be improved.",

The objectives were to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella in pig slaughterhouses and to identify risk factors associated with the contamination of pig carcasses. Data was collected from 12 slaughterhouses in five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom). Isolates were characterized by serotyping, phage typing and antimicrobial susceptibility. In one country, no Salmonella was found. Salmonella was isolated from 5.3% of 3485 samples of pork and from 13.8% of 3573 environmental samples from the seven slaughterhouses in the four remaining countries. The statistical analyses (multi-level logistic regression) indicated that the prevalence was significantly higher during the warmer months and that the environmental contamination increased during the day of slaughter. The polishing (OR 3.74, 95% CI 1.43-9.78) and pluck removal (OR 3.63, 95% CI, 1.66-7.96) processes were found to contribute significantly to the total carcass contamination, the latter especially if the scalding water also was contaminated. To reduce carcass contamination, it is recommended to ensure sufficiently high temperatures of scalding water (62 °C) and appropriate cleaning and disinfection of the polishing equipment at least once a day in order to reduce the level of carcass contamination and consequently the prevalence of Salmonella in pork.",

The strong thermal treatment during the production process by pasteurization of raw milk, subsequent evaporation and spray drying leads to a very high milk safety. An entry of Salmonellae into the end product can be almost excluded this way. In the environment of the production plants, the presence of Salmonellae may present a risk to the product due to recontamination. The entrance of Salmonellae into the production plants may initially occur unnoticed such as leakages in the roof area or due to insufficient filtering of the air. Once Salmonellae are settled, the same serovar can be detected in the concerned plant for many years. A Salmonella contamination of the environment involves the danger of recontaminations of the product. The uneven distribution and the occurrence of the Salmonellae in \"nests\" make it difficult to prove the contamination of a batch with random sampling plans. On the background of the assumption that if Salmonellae do not occur in the production environment, a recontamination of the final product is also excluded, it is more reasonable to examine the samples from the environment. For the empirical detection of process safety based on examinations of end products and/or of samples from the environment, ~700 end product samples (1994-2004) and ~1300 samples from the environment of the drying plant (1994-2005) were examined per year in a milk drying company with well-known environmental Salmonella contamination. No Salmonellae were detected in the end product. The findings from the environmental monitoring were taken into account with respect to measures for improving process and environmental hygiene, and appropriate recommendations were derived. In this context, the entrance and spread of Salmonellae were shown. In addition, typing of Salmonellae isolates was made using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. The occurrence of uniform clones of S. Mbandaka, S. Ohio and S. Senftenberg was confirmed. The investigation showed that for the concerned company, a weekly sampling of 25 environmental samples under renouncement of final product samples can be considered as being sufficient for warranting process safety. In this connection, it is important that the \"sampling points\" be selected accordingly in order to ensure a representative result. Based on experience, the safety of an environmental monitoring plan can only be empirically identified and not computed. General validity cannot be derived for such a monitoring plan, since it has to be adapted for each company situation.",

		"abstract": "Background. In September 1994, the Minnesota Department of Health detected an increase in the number of reports of Salmonella enteritidis infections. After a case-control study implicated a nationally distributed brand of ice cream (Schwan's) in the outbreak, the product was recalled and further epidemiologic and microbiologic investigations were conducted. Methods. We defined an outbreak-associated case of S. enteritidis infection as one in which S. enteritidis was cultured from a person who became ill in September or October 1994. We established national surveillance and surveyed customers of the implicated manufacturer. The steps involved in the manufacture of ice cream associated with cases of S. enteritidis infection were compared with those of products not known to be associated with infection matched for the date of manufacture. Cultures for bacteria were obtained from ice cream samples, the ice cream plant, and tanker trailers that had transported the ice cream base (premix) to the plant. Results. We estimate that S. enteritidis gastroenteritis developed in 224,000 persons in the United States after they ate Schwan's ice cream. The attack rate for consumers was 6.6 percent. Ice cream associated with infection contained a higher percentage of premix that had been transported by tanker trailers that had carried nonpasteurized eggs immediately before (P=0.02). S. enteritidis was isolated from 8 of 266 ice cream products (3 percent), but not from environmental samples obtained from the ice cream plant (n= 157) or tanker trailers (n=204). Conclusions. This nationwide outbreak of salmonellosis was most likely the result of contamination of pasteurized ice cream premix during transport in tanker trailers that had previously carried nonpasteurized liquid eggs containing S. enteritidis. To prevent further outbreaks, food products not destined for repasteurization should be transported in dedicated containers.",

Samples were collected from live broiler chickens and chicken carcasses as well as the slaughterhouse environment. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 40 of 71 (56% with a confidence interval 5% [45-67]) broiler chicken flocks at slaughter. The most prominent serovars were Blockley (31%), Typhimurium and Brancaster (14%), Hadar (10%), Salmonella multidrug resistant clinical organisms serotypes 1,4,[5],12:i:-, and Virchow (8%) and Livingstone, St. Paul, Seftenberg, Llandoff, Infantis and Indiana. At the farm, 27% of the broiler chicken flocks tested positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 124 of 497 environmental samples (25%). In most cases, there was no relationship between pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern and antibiotic resistance pattern. The predominant Salmonella serovars were susceptible to most of the tested antibiotic drugs, but S. Hadar exhibited multidrug resistance.

		"abstract": "New consumer tendencies are focused on products derived from systems which allow both a high animal welfare condition and a high food safety level. However, sometimes animal welfare regulations make the adoption of adequate bio-security measures difficult, representing a barrier for animal health and food safety. Thus the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Salmonella at different points of the pig slaughtering process (Trucks, Lairage, Slaughter line and Quartering, TLSQ) from pigs reared in free-range systems. From eight samplings a total of 126 Salmonella isolates out of 1160 different samples were recovered (10.86%). The highest percentage of isolates was detected at the points of pre-scalding (29/80, 36.25%), trucks (13/56, 23.21%), cecal contents (17/80, 21.25%), tonsils (14/80, 17.50%), ileocecal lymph nodes (13/80, 16.25%) and lairage (9/64, 14.06%). Furthermore, eighteen isolates were obtained from different environmental samples from slaughter line and quartering plant (knives and surface of tables) (5.63%) and three isolates at the quartering plant samples (ham, shoulder and loin) (3.75%). Fourteen different serotypes were isolated: Bredeney, Rissen, Derby, Typhimurium, Montevideo, Israel, Anatum, Emek, Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium (mST), Choleraesuis, Durban, Kentucky, London and Sandiego. S. Typhimurium phage types U311, 193, 104b and UT were identified. Moreover, mST strain was phage typed as U311. From TLSQ1, TLSQ2 and TLSQ4, different strains of S. Derby, S. Rissen and S. Bredeney serotypes were isolated from pig and environmental samples, pointing to a potential cross contamination. Molecular typing (Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, PFGE) of these strains confirmed the cross contamination. In the remaining samplings, different serotypes were obtained in each sampled point of the chain, assuming that the isolated serotypes belonged to different epidemiological origins. Our results show the isolation of different serotypes of Salmonella spp. from both pigs and environmental samples, which constitutes a great risk for the contamination of pork from free-range pigs both prior and post slaughter. These data support the intensification of the cleaning and disinfection in the pre-slaughter environment (i.e. trucks, lairage), especially when a higher workload is present, as well as the inclusion of new strategies to decrease or eliminate the risk of Salmonella spp. infection or recontamination from the environment in pork from organic or eco-friendly systems.

Methodology: A survey on Salmonella in two beef production lines (a beef abattoir line and a processing line) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was conducted, with a total of 668 various samples randomly collected from animal-related materials, the environment, and a beef product (mortadella). Results: Overall, a 12.9% prevalence (26.3% from the abattoir line, 5.3% from the processing plant line) was observed. The prevalence in the abattoir line environment (36.6%) was higher than that in animal-related samples (14.7%); the reverse was true for the processing plant line. Out of 86 isolates, 10 serovars were identified, and 8 remained unidentified. The predominant serotypes were S. Saintpaul (32.5%), S. Muenchen (19.8%), and S. Larochelle (12.8%). S. Kastrup and S.

Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected. Total psychrotrophic aerobic bacterial counts (TPAC) in water samples, fresh produce and environmental samples suggested that the TPAC is not a good indicator of overall quality and best manufacturing practices during production and processing. Because of the high TPAC in harvested lettuces processing water becomes contaminated quickly, and subsequent TPAC do not change much throughout the production process of a batch. The hygiene indicator Escherichia coli was used to assess water management practices in these 2 companies in relation to food safety. Practices such as insufficient cleaning and disinfection of washing baths, irregular refilling of the produce wash baths with water of good microbial quality, and use of high product/water ratios resulted in a rapid increase in E. coli in processing water, with potential transfer to the end product (fresh-cut lettuce). The washing step in the production of fresh-cut lettuce was identified as a potential pathway for dispersion of microorganisms and introduction of E. coli to the end product via cross-contamination. An intervention step to reduce microbial contamination is required, particularly when no sanitizers are used as is the case in some EU countries. Proper water management (and its validation) is a critical point in the fresh-cut produce processing industry.",

The ensuing investigation, which involved Canadian and American public health and food regulatory agencies and an academic research laboratory, is summarized. Laboratory-based surveillance, including phage typing and PFGE, was used to identify cases, while questionnaires were used to collect information about food and environmental exposures. A case-control study with 16 matched case-control pairs was conducted to test the hypothesis of an association between raw whole almond consumption and infection. Almond samples were collected from case homes, retail outlets and the implicated processor, and environmental samples were collected from processing equipment and associated farms for microbiological testing. 168 confirmed cases of SE PT30 infection (157 in Canada, 11 in the USA) were identified between Oct. 2000 and July 2001. The case-control study identified raw whole almonds as the source of infection (odds ration, 21.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to ). SE PT30 was detected in raw whole natural almonds collected from home, retail, distribution and warehouse sources and from the environmental samples. The frequent, prolonged recovery of this specific organism from a large agricultural area was an unexpected finding and may indicate significant diffuse contamination on these farms. Identification of almonds as the source of a foodborne outbreak is thought to be a previously undocumented finding, leading to a N. American recall of this product and a review of current industry practices.",

		"abstract": "The effects of sanitation treatments including chlorination (ca 10 ppm available chlorine) of agricultural water and ethyl alcohol (70%) spraying on packing shed equipment on microbial contamination on fruits and the environment were determined and compared with those in conventionally managed field and packing shed in persimmon and satsuma mandarin orchards. Chlorinated water reduced the microbial counts to levels below the lower limit of detection (1.4 log CFU/ml for bacteria and 2.0 log CFU/ml for fungi) in most agricultural water samples. Microbial counts of pesticide solution, which contained the agricultural water or chlorinated water for the mixture, were lower in sanitary field than in control field in both fruit orchards. The number of bacterial and mold species detected in agricultural water, chlorinated water, and pesticide solution were almost proportional to microbial counts in each sample throughout the year. The chlorination treatment of agricultural water tended to reduce the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit during production season. The ethyl alcohol spray treatment on packing shed equipment resulted in a substantial microbial reduction on plastic harvest basket and container in persimmon orchard and plastic harvest basket and container, gloves, scissors, and size sorter in satsuma mandarin orchard. The spray application on packing shed equipment reduced the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit by >1 log CFU/g. The number of satsuma mandarin packing shed equipment containing the species found on fruit peel was higher in control than in sanitary packing shed. No human pathogens such as verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella were detected in any of the fruit and environmental samples. These results indicate that uses of sanitizers such as chlorine for agricultural water and ethyl alcohol for packing shed equipment would be useful in a good agricultural practices program of persimmons and satsuma mandarin.",

		"abstract": "Cross-contamination can be broadly defined as the transfer, direct or indirect, of microorganisms from a contaminated product to a non-contaminated product. Events  that may result in cross-contamination include inadequate hygiene practices,  contaminated equipment surfaces, contamination via food handling personnel, further  product processing, or storage abuse All of these niches require consistent  environmental surveillance systems to monitor microbial harborage sites to prevent  foodborne illnesses via cross-contamination. Environmental surveillance is achieved  through routine surface sampling of the food contact surfaces and surrounding areas.  To better understand cross-contamination, the role of environmental surface  transmission during outbreaks due to the presence and persistence of pathogenic  microorganisms on various food contact surfaces must be investigated. However,  studies on environmental sampling techniques are rarely performed in an actual food  processing environment but rather under controlled variables within a  laboratory-setting. Moreover, results and conclusions of studies differ because of  the considerable variability across surface sampling tools due to individual  operator dependency, low recovery rates, and low reproducibility. Information is  also often lacking on environmental sampling tools used within a processing  facility, the characterization of these tools, and the optimization of recovery of  microorganisms for surface sampling. Thus, this review aims to: (1) discuss and  compare factors impacting the recovery of microorganisms and the standardization of  surface sampling methods for optimal recovery of microorganisms and (2) examine how  research strategies could focus more towards the development of standard  methodologies for surface sampling.",

		"abstract": "Introduction. Competitive exclusion of environmental pathogens by the application of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been applied in a number of food processing industries. Ready-to-eat individually quick frozen fruit is a primary component of \"smoothies\" in today's fast-paced food consumption. Processing RTE foods requires an extensive sanitation and environmental monitoring program (EMP) to prevent the formation of resident pathogen biofilms of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp., which are primary pathogens of concern. Purpose. Our goal is to competitively exclude environmental pathogens L. monocytogenes and Salmonella in order to prevent contamination of fresh fruit processed in season by introducing probiotics to the environment of frozen fruit processing facilities. Methods. A six-month evaluation, commencing with pre-season inoculation of the processing environment to known historical pathogen niches with a of strains of a pre-biotic formulation of LAB. The pre-biotic LAB cocktail received incremental sanitation chemical application to develop resistance anticipated for seasonal processing. Seasonal processing was a +90-day duration of LAB application and monitoring. To validate the presence and learn the influence of sanitation chemicals on LAB population, before- and after-sanitation samples were collected for LAB, environmental, and general indicator microbes. The viability of microbes was tested using the spread-plating method, where the viable plate count was calculated in CFU/ml. Standard sanitation operating procedures were maintained, supported by the EMP. Results. Results confirm LAB resistance development, where after-sanitation samples showed >330 CFU/ml of LAB and aerobic plate count (APC); hence, results proportionally showed <10 CFU/ml of coliforms, yeast, and mold. All environmental samples showed negative for L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. LAB survival increases the APC, decreases the counts of coliforms by consumption, and finally decreases counts of yeast and mold. Significance. Implemented a potentially new food plant sanitation discipline, other than standard chemistry, to mitigate the risk of environmental pathogens by inoculating and developing a resistant LAB population, occupying the microbial niches favored by pathogens. Goal is to create a microbiome with beneficial resident microbial community, outcompeting the introduced transient pathogens, preventing resident biofilm formation.",

		"abstract": "Introduction. Cleaning and sanitation programs are a regulatory requirement in the food industry. A quarter of United States food recalls are caused by probable contamination arising from poor plant sanitation and environmental monitoring standards. The study, therefore, proposes that FDA′s Food Recall entries should clearly indicate such root cause(s) for each recall, for the benefit of the industry and the public. Purpose. To study recent pathogen- and allergen-related FDA recalls, and use these as a basis to provide risk-based industry sanitation recommendations. Methods. Three-hundred eleven relevant data points were evaluated from the FDA′s Recall entries from July 2017 to June 2018. Results. Based on the analysis of evaluated recall entries: i) Half of the FDA recalls were due to undeclared allergens, of such recalls, 4.6 to 32.4% may have happened because of allergen cross-contact incidents in plants. Milk, multiple allergen products and tree nuts were the top three allergens implicated in these recalls. ii) Listeria (21.5%) and Salmonella (17.7%) were the significant pathogens implicated in recalls. Of Listeria-related recalls, 98.5% were due to plant sanitation issues, whereas with Salmonella, 63.6 to 96.3% of related recalls may be due to plant issues. iii) Overall, 37.9 to 59.8% of FDA recalls could be plant sanitation or environmental hygiene-related. This wide percentage range may be attributed to a lack of appreciable clarity on the root cause of contamination of the violative product. Significance. If such root cause(s) of product contamination were clearly communicated within FDA′s food recall entries, then this data could be used by the industry to improve their sanitary design, performance, and maintenance programs. This should eventually help in preventing or significantly minimizing food recalls, inspection violations, and foodborne illnesses.",

The contents of 2400 shell eggs (20 eggs per pool), 75 pasteurized liquid egg products, and 120 unpasteurized liquid egg products from 8 egg-breaking plants in South Korea were examined. In liquid egg samples, 4 Salmonella-positive samples from 120 unpasteurized ones (3.3%) and 5 positive samples from 75 pasteurized ones (6.7%) were identified; no eggs were positive for Salmonella among shell egg samples. To trace the source of Salmonella, we revisited the 2 Salmonella-positive plants (plants A and C). We investigated the equipment and environments of the plants and a henhouse (farm A) that supplied shell eggs to plant A, and collected additional liquid eggs and shell eggs from plants A and C. All Salmonella isolates from plant A and the associated farm A, except for a single Typhimurium strain from farm A, were serotyped as Bareilly. Three serovars, including one Bareilly, four Tennessee, and one Richmond, were isolated from plant C. Most Salmonella isolates were susceptible to tested antibiotics. To identify differences between isolates, molecular subtyping by using the automated rep-PCR system was conducted. All Salmonella Bareilly (S. Bareilly) strains from plant A exhibited high similarity, indicating possible contamination by Salmonella strains from the henhouse A. Meanwhile, 2 S.

		"abstract": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that Salmonella on New Zealand eggs is not an important pathway for human salmonellosis. However, robust nationally representative data for Salmonella contamination of eggs is not available to support this. To better understand the exposure of New Zealand commercial eggs to Salmonella, a cross-sectional survey collected data on prevalence and serotypes of Salmonella in the feed, laying sheds (feces, dust, and boot or manure belt swabs), and packhouses (egg contact surfaces) of New Zealand commercial egg layer farms. Salmonella was not detected on 16 of 28 surveyed farms, and 4 farms had only one positive sample. Of the 43 (13.3%) of 323 Salmonella-positive samples, dust samples had the highest prevalence (19 of 67, 28.4%), followed by boot or manure belt swabs (11 of 67, 16.4%), feces (7 of 67, 10.4%), packhouse egg contact surfaces (5 of 87, 5.7%), and feed (1 of 33, 3.0%). A significantly higher prevalence was from caged (33 of 75, 44.0%; P<0.001) compared with cage-free (4 of 126, 3.2%) systems, yet multiple practices differ between laying systems, which could influence prevalence. Salmonella-positive packhouse samples were only identified on the three farms with the highest laying shed prevalence, and isolates were genetically related (as determined by single nucleotide polymorphism analyses) suggesting cross-contamination between the laying shed and packhouse surfaces. Serotypes isolated included Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Thompson, Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Anatum, and Salmonella Mbandaka. Importantly, Salmonella Enteritidis, which causes egg-associated outbreaks internationally, was not isolated. Genomic comparisons of isolates supported the presence of a common contamination source in the shed and farm environments rather than multiple sporadic contamination events. This survey establishes a benchmark of Salmonella prevalence and types in the New Zealand egg production environment and provides a reference point for assessing the impact of changes to practices on Salmonella prevalence. HIGHLIGHTS Salmonella prevalence was lower than from similar international surveys. The highest prevalence was from pooled dust samples. Salmonella occurred on packhouse egg contact surfaces from high-prevalence farms. Isolates from the same farm, laying shed, and packhouse were genetically related. Isolates included common New Zealand serotypes; Salmonella Enteritidis was not found.",

Over 19 years, there were intermittent issues in foods and/or food processing environment with coliforms (153 (46%) of 330 food samples and 26 (17%) of 153 environmental samples); generic E. coli (20 (nine percent) of 234 food samples and one (two percent) of 50 environmental samples); Listeria spp. (20 (five percent) of 406 food samples and 23 (17%) of 137 environmental samples); and L. monocytogenes (10 (two percent) of 406 food samples and 10 (seven percent) of 137 environmental samples); S. aureus (38 (17%) of 224 food samples) and Salmonella spp. (one (one percent) of 91 food samples) were observed. L. monocytogenes contaminated cheese led to three voluntary recalls (2006, 2010, 2012), although no outbreaks or illnesses were linked to the DPF. Issues likely to have contributed to microbial contamination were traced to process failure and methods changes (brine and rind washing; spice and herb additions) water for product chilling; UV bulb failure; inadequate worker hygiene and wound policy; mastitis in introduced dairy cows affecting pooled milk and raw cheese; building design; process flow; and inadequate processing environment sanitation. Significance. This research highlights the importance of risk-based inspection and environmental testing programs in the prevention of foodborne illness outbreaks, and the significance of collaborative approach between the industry and inspection authorities in protecting public health.",

Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from liquid egg yolk and liquid egg white in Oct., but was not found in any other samples (50 liquid egg samples, 21 containers and 94 attached production facilities and gloves). Data suggest that the contamination rate (3.8%) is lower than those previously reported. Total bacterial plate counts, Gram positive bacterial counts and Gram negative bacterial counts were in the ranges 2-5, 2-3 and 2-5 log cfu/g, respectively. Liquid egg containers returned from customers were found to be contaminated with bacteria at the level of 8 log cfu/container. However, washing and application of a sanitizer containing sodium hypochlorite reduced bacterial counts.",

		"abstract": "The microbiological performance of a food safety management system in a food service operation was measured using a microbiological assessment scheme as a vertical sampling plan throughout the production process, from raw materials to final product. The assessment scheme can give insight into the microbiological contamination and the variability of a production process and pinpoint bottlenecks in the food safety management system. Three production processes were evaluated: a high-risk sandwich production process (involving raw meat preparation), a medium-risk hot meal production process (starting from undercooked raw materials), and a low-risk hot meal production process (reheating in a bag). Microbial quality parameters, hygiene indicators, and relevant pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli O157) were in accordance with legal criteria and/or microbiological guidelines, suggesting that the food safety management system was effective. High levels of total aerobic bacteria (>3.9 log CFU/50 cm2) were noted occasionally on gloves of food handlers and on food contact surfaces, especially in high contamination areas (e.g., during handling of raw material, preparation room). Core control activities such as hand hygiene of personnel and cleaning and disinfection (especially in highly contaminated areas) were considered points of attention. The present sampling plan was used to produce an overall microbiological profile (snapshot) to validate the food safety management system in place.",

A total of 77 culture-confirmed Salmonella Newport and 30 Salmonella Reading cases, including 1 case with a double infection, were reported. All strains isolated from the patients were subtyped using serotyping, microbial resistance profiling, and PFGE. Here, the PFGE patterns of the studied Salmonella Newport strains were identical, whereas 4 different PFGE profiles were found among the Salmonella Reading strains. 2 elderly patients died within 2 wk of the onset of symptoms. 3 geographical clusters of cases with an epidemiological link were identified. The traceback investigation suggested that the factor connecting the cases was ready-chopped iceberg lettuce available for mass catering use. However, none of the tested food, environmental samples, or the samples taken from the staff of the processing plant contained Salmonella bacteria.

		"abstract": "In a study of 1400 manufacturing butchers' premises, 23 30 raw prepared meats, 2192 cooked meats and 4635 environmental samples were examined. Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157 VTEC) was isolated from five of 1400 (0.4%) premises. Three raw meat products contained 0157 VTEC, and two raw meat preparation areas and two items of equipment used exclusively for cooked meats were contaminated with O157 VTEC. Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. were detected in 84 of 2330 (4%) and 15 of 2330 (0.6%) raw meat products, respectively. Of the cooked meats examined, seven of 2192 (0.3%) samples were of unacceptable microbiological quality and a further 352 (16%) were of unsatisfactory quality. Of the unacceptable samples, two contained Salmonella spp. (Salm. typhimurium DT193, Salm. typhimurium PT104), three contained Staphylococcus aureus in excess of 104 cfu g-1, and two contained E. coli in excess of 104 cfu g-1. Neither Campylobacter spp. nor O157 VTEC were detected in cooked meats. In the majority of premises, raw and unwrapped cooked meat products were physically separated in displays (94%) and refrigerators (81%), and dedicated equipment/utensils (69-89%) were used for raw meat and unwrapped cooked meat products and other ready-to-eat foods. In approximately half (48%), there were separate serving counters and in 13%, separate staff for raw and cooked meats. Most managers (75%) had received some food hygiene training. However, in 29% of premises, one or more members of staff handled raw and then cooked or ready-to-eat foods without washing their hands, and in 11%, one or more staff members handled raw and cooked meats directly with bare hands. A documented hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system was present in 17% of premises and in a further 31%, an undocumented HACCP system was in place. The low incidence of food-borne pathogens in cooked meat products and in the environmental areas examined, together with a high level of physical separation of raw and cooked meats, indicate that most manufacturing butchers' premises have appropriate physical control measures in place. However, HACCP and hygienic practice are areas that require improvement to reduce the risk of cross-contamination with food-borne pathogens from raw to cooked meats.",

Carcasses were sampled using a swabbing method, with flank, thorax lateral, brisket, breast and perineal region as sampling sites. For each sample, total viable counts (TVC), bifidobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp., total coliform and Escherichia coli counts were obtained. Samples were examined for the presence of Salmonella spp., Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes. High levels of total viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts were observed on carcasses immediately after slaughter, ranging from 5.80 to 6.74 and from 2.25 to 3.43 log10 cfu/cm2, respectively. In general, chilling of carcasses reduced bacterial contamination (P < 0.001). With the exception of bifidobacteria, cutting and deboning increased bacterial numbers (P < 0.001). Prevalence of Salmonella spp. was highest on carcasses immediately after slaughter, whilst prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes was highest on food contact surfaces sampled in the cutting area (5.1, 45.6 and 11.4 %, respectively). The layout and facilities of abattoirs, as well as slaughter practices, appeared to influence the contamination of carcasses. Bacterial numbers of environmental samples suggest that the processing environment may play a major role in final contamination level.",

		"abstract": "Stakeholder requirements force companies to analyse their food safety management system (FSMS) performance to improve food safety. Performance is commonly analysed by checking compliance against preset requirements via audits/inspections, or actual food safety (FS) output is analysed by microbiological testing. This paper discusses the usefulness of a concurrent diagnosis of FSMS performance and FS output using new tools; illustrated for three meat-processing companies. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. (food safety indicators), Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae (hygiene indicators), and total viable counts TVC (overall performance) were analysed at ten critical sampling locations covering both product and environmental samples, using the Microbial Assessment Scheme diagnosis. Riskiness of FSMS context and performance of core FSMS activities were assessed using a diagnostic tool (including 51 indicators and corresponding grids with level descriptions). For the (large) beef meat processor, the FS output diagnosis showed too high TVC but the high activity scores of their FSMS indicated that this problem could be only solved by supplier measures. Likewise, for the (medium-size) poultry meat processor, the activity/context diagnosis showed a clear dependency on suppliers. However, the FS output diagnosis revealed a broader contamination problem, and additional measures to improve, amongst others, sanitation program, compliance to procedures, personal hygienic requirements seem necessary. The FS output diagnosis of the (small) lamb meat processor showed various contamination problems (but no pathogens) corresponding with various low activity levels in combination with he high-risk context. The combined diagnosis provided clear directions for improvement to move towards more advanced FSMS activity levels or to reduce riskiness in context. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",

		"abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study was (i) To attempt isolation and identification of Salmonella species from samples. (ii) Serotyping of Salmonella isolates. (iii) Detection of virulence factor associated genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and Methods: A total of 284 samples comprised of chevon and mutton (112 samples each) as well as 60 samples (20 each of retail meat shops environment samples viz. Butchers' hands, knives and log swabs) were collected from the retail meat shops in and around Anand City under aseptic precautions. Rappaport-vassiliadis soy bean meal broth and tetrathionate broth was used for the enrichment of all the samples and inoculation was done on brilliant green agar and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. This was followed by the confirmation of isolates using biochemical tests. For the serotyping, isolates were sent to the National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre, Central Research Institute, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh. Detection of virulence genes was performed by PCR technique using previously reported primer. Result: Of 284 meats and retail meat shops environment samples, 13 (4.58%) samples were found positive for Salmonella. It was interesting to know that incidence of Salmonella was more in mutton (6.25%) than chevon (3.57%). In case of meat shop environmental samples 1 (5.00%) sample observed positive for Salmonella separately among the butchers' hands and knives swabs (Each of 20 samples) examined. Out of 13, eleven isolates detected as Salmonella Typhimurium, whereas only two isolates were detected as Salmonella Enteritidis. All Salmonella isolates possess invA and stn genes, whereas nine isolates had a presence of spvR gene while only five of the isolates revealed the presence of spvC gene as shown by in vitro detection of virulence genes by PCR. Conclusion: Therefore, might be suggested that the good hygiene practices and effective control measures should be taken to encourage clean meat production with prolonged shelf-life.",

		"abstract": "A systematic approach in monitoring the hygiene of a meat processing plant using classical microbiological analyses combined with molecular characterization tools may assist in the safety of the final products. This study aimed: (i) to evaluate the total hygiene level and, (ii) to monitor and characterize the occurrence and spread of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the environment and the final products of a meat industry that processes meat of global origin. In total, 2541 samples from the processing environment, the raw materials, and the final products were collected from a Greek meat industry in the period 2011-2013. All samples were subjected to enumeration of total viable counts (TVC), Escherichia coli (EC) and total coliforms (TCC) and the detection of Salmonella spp., while 709 of these samples were also analyzed for the presence L. monocytogenes. Pathogen isolates were serotyped and further characterized for their antibiotic resistance and subtyped by PFGE. Raw materials were identified as the primary source of contamination, while improper handling might have also favored the proliferation of the initial microbial load. The occurrence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes reached 5.5% and 26.9%, respectively. Various (apparent) cross-contamination or persistence trends were deduced based on PFGE analysis results. Salmonella isolates showed wide variation in their innate antibiotic resistance, contrary to L. monocytogenes ones, which were found susceptible to all antibiotics except for cefotaxime. The results emphasize the biodiversity of foodborne pathogens in a meat industry and may be used by meat processors to understand the spread of pathogens in the processing environment, as well as to assist the Food Business Operator (FBO) in establishing effective criteria for selection of raw materials and in improving meat safety and quality. This approach can limit the increase of microbial contamination during the processing steps observed in our study as well as the cross contamination of meat products.",

It is especially useful as a verification activity when an environmental pathogen is identified as a significant hazard, i.e., \"hazard requiring a preventive control.\" The FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Food (PCHF) requirements indicate that ready-to-eat food could be contaminated with environmental pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella, which must be considered in hazard analysis. The environmental pathogen monitoring is also stressed in the FDA's draft guidance. Thus, the environmental pathogen monitoring program is helpful in verifying that the factory hygiene and sanitation and other preventive controls designed to assure food safety are working effectively. This symposium will focus on environmental pathogen monitoring program and its role in implementation of FSMA Preventive Controls for Human Food (PCHF). Speakers from industry, academia, and regulatory agency will provide updates and review key aspects of design and implementation of environmental monitoring program and analytical methods, including recent advances in rapid detection of environmental pathogens, as well as data interpretation, source tracking, and strategic use of environmental monitoring for food safety assurance and regulatory compliance. It will also include discussion of the FDA's expectation and guidance regarding environmental pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes.",

		"abstract": "The 23 restaurant-associated salmonellosis outbreaks that occurred in Minnesota from 1995 through 2003 were reviewed to characterize the role of infected foodworkers. The median duration of the outbreaks was 21 days (range, 1 to 517 days). The median number of culture-confirmed patron cases per outbreak was seven (range, 1 to 36 cases). The median incubation for patron cases ranged from 9 h to 5.9 days. A specific food vehicle was implicated in four outbreaks and suspected in five. Salmonella of the same serotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtype as that found in patrons was recovered from foodworkers in 19 outbreaks. Overall, 12% (129 of 1,033) of foodworkers tested positive for Salmonella. Sixty-four (53%) of 121 Salmonella-positive foodworkers reported not having had a recent gastrointestinal illness. Overall, the median duration of Salmonella shedding was 16 days. Among foodworkers who reported gastrointestinal illness, the median shedding duration was 30 days as compared with 3 days for asymptomatic foodworkers. Positive environmental samples were recovered in 4 (33%) of 12 outbreaks. No specific food vehicle was identified in any outbreaks associated with Salmonella-positive environmental samples. The median duration of outbreaks with positive environmental samples (187 days) was significantly longer than the median duration of outbreaks with negative environmental results (26 days, P = 0.03). A higher proportion of Salmonella-positive foodworkers (22 versus 8%) was identified in outbreaks with positive environmental samples. Salmonella outbreaks in restaurants are frequently prolonged yet produce a small number of confirmed patron cases. Prolonged outbreak durations suggest a persistent reservoir of contamination. Infected foodworkers likely serve as an important source for Salmonella transmission. Therefore, assessment of foodworker infection is essential for controlling restaurant outbreaks.",

Enteritidis), in Western Japan, an investigation was conducted of the chicken industry and environmental sources between 1995 and 1998. Salmonellae were isolated from 34 of 90 samples (37.8%) of raw chicken parts, 34 of 98 faecal samples (34.7%) at 35 broiler farms, 11 of 59 samples (18.6%) of liquid eggs, and from 71 of 272 samples (26.1%) of swab specimens from equipment and cracked or faecally soiled shell eggs at the processing facilities. Salmonellae, including S. Enteritidis, were also isolated from swab samples of hen-houses associated with one of the shell-egg processing facilities (11 samples out of 55, 20%). In the broiler meat production environment, S. Infantis was dominant. Twenty-two of 36 sewage samples (61.1%) and 16 of 72 samples (22.2%) taken from 5 rivers contained salmonellae including S. Enteritidis. S. Enteritidis isolates were analysed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using enzyme Bln I. Thirty-four isolates from shell-egg processing facilities and henhouses, obtained over several years, had the same pulsed-field profile as isolates obtained from four individual outbreaks that occurred in this location in 1997. One of the clonal lines of S. Enteritidis, among multiple serovars of salmonellae in the environment, was thought to have distributed in reservoirs, laying hens, for several years, and continued to cause outbreaks in this area.",

Fruit samples were picked at the formation stage (April), hardening stage (May), and harvesting stage (June), and orchard environmental samples were collected each month from April to June. Microbial counts in the fruit at the formation and hardening stages were below the detection limit. The bacteria and moulds isolated from the fruit at these stages were soilborne bacteria and phytopathogenic moulds, which were found in the soil and agricultural water. Agricultural water was one of the most important potential sources of contamination during the production season, because verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli based on the LAMP assay was detected in agricultural water and in weeds after irrigation in April. No Salmonella based on the LAMP assay was detected from any of the samples. At the fruit harvesting stage, only counts of fungi in the peel were above the detection limit, and a wide variety of bacterial flora and mould flora was found in the peel. The microflora in the peel comprised of bacteria and moulds living in the plant-soil environment, which were often found in the soil, agricultural water, screen laid on the ground for the harvesting of naturally fallen fruits, harvest bag and containers, and gloves. These results indicate that monitoring and management on-farm should focus on the agricultural water, soil, and harvesting equipment as important control points to reduce microbial contamination of Japanese apricots.",

Each of the houses was environmentally controlled and fitted with egg belts that transported eggs from the houses to the egg-processing facility. Four hundred twenty-eight Salmonella isolates were obtained from 904 environmental samples collected from the houses. Two hundred fifty-two of the 428 (58.9%) isolates yielded five serotypes as follows: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Livingstone, Salmonella serovar Cerro, Salmonella serovar Montevideo, Salmonella serovar Mbandaka, and Salmonella serovar Corvallis. The remaining (41.1%, 176 of 428) isolates included four other serotypes and isolates that were untypeable. Salmonella isolates obtained from the drain water collected after the washing of the eggs in the egg-processing facility yielded the same serotypes as those found in the chicken houses. Strains having an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern were continually recovered from a house for more than 1 year. Several strains of Salmonella Cerro, Salmonella Mbandaka, and Salmonella Montevideo obtained from both the houses and from the egg-processing facility were indistinguishable by PFGE, respectively. These results suggest that Salmonella organisms originating from a single clone colonized the chicken houses and that the egg belts are likely to be one of the means by which Salmonella organisms are spread from one house to the others.",

The analysis data sets included 153 federally inspected young chicken slaughter establishments, of which 111 exceeded half the Salmonella performance standard at least once from 2003 through 2005, and 121 federally inspected pork slaughter establishments, of which 28 exceeded half the Salmonella performance standard. Logistic regression results for young chicken slaughter establishments indicate they were more likely to exceed half the standard if they had higher inspection noncompliance rates (P=0.10) and older production space (P=0.10), and were less likely to exceed it if they used a higher percentage of raw poultry inputs purchased from outside sources (P=0.10). Results for pork slaughter establishments indicate they were more likely to exceed half the standard if they had a higher rate of voluntary microbiological testing (P=0.08), and were less likely to exceed it if they were larger (P=0.08) and used a higher percentage of raw pork inputs purchased from outside sources (P=0.02).

This study aimed to identify critical points in iced beverage production and distribution lines to examine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in a beverage and its processing environment, as well as when water and ice used as main ingredients. Methodology: The critical points were determined using the principles of Hazard Analytical Critical Control Point (HACCP) to analyze each processing and distribution step from the survey. Samples collected from the points of concern based on the critical points that were found were tested for pathogens by conventional method and molecular method using primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Escherichia coli was found in 6.34% of samples, and 0.7% of them were confirmed as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by PCR. Vibrio cholerae was found in in 0.7% of water samples used to make iced beverages and in ice production, as well as in 2.12% of distribution and production tools. Salmonella Typhimurium was found in 1.4% of water samples used to make ice and ice products. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 2.02% of the surfaces of ice distribution and production tools and in 5.05% of production and distribution workers' hands. S. aureus counts ranged from 2.4*102-3.5*102 colonies/100 cm2 surface area and 1.9*101-3.7*102 colonies/workers' hands. Conclusion: Control on many critical points in iced beverage processing and distribution is required so that the beverages are safe for consumption.",

Samples of different chocolate types, processed cocoa-based ingredients, manufacturing environment, and workers' hand surfaces were analyzed. Salmonella and Escherichia coli were not detected. However, in 25.8% of the chocolate samples, Enterobacteriaceae were isolated while total coliforms were detected in 13.3%. Among the processed cocoa-based ingredients, two samples of cocoa liquor showed contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and total coliforms, and in one sample thermotolerant coliforms were also recovered. For equipment and utensils, Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in around 25.4% of the samples, whereas total coliforms were detected in 10.2%. Moreover, in company A 14.3% of manufacturing environment samples were contaminated by thermotolerant coliforms. The food handlers from both companies showed a high percentage of Enterobacteriaceae contamination on their hands. The results showed that the manufacturing environment including food handlers was considered the most likely Enterobacteriaceae contamination source of the finished product. These data also highlight Enterobacteriaceae as a good hygiene indicator for the chocolate industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",

		"abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of various Salmonella serotypes in chickens, carcass contact surfaces as well as environmental samples collected from wet markets and small scale processing plant. Materials and Methods: A total of 182 poultry and environmental samples were collected at random on separate occasions from wet markets and small scale processing plant, during the period of October 2014 to July 2015 in Penang and Perlis, Malaysia. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella using ISO 6579:2002 conventional culture-based method. Presumptive Salmonella colonies were subjected to various biochemical tests (such as triple sugar iron and lysine iron test), serologically confirmed using polyvalent O and H antisera and further serotyped at Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Perak, Malaysia. Results: Salmonella serotypes were isolated from 161 out of 182 samples (88.46%) with 100% prevalence in the whole chicken carcass and chicken cuts - as well as transport crate, cage, drum, knife, chopping board, display table, floor, bench wash water, wash water, and drain water. Salmonella was isolated from 91.67%, 83.33%, and 66.67% of defeathering machines, drain swabs, and apron, respectively. 17 serotypes were isolated in this study with Salmonella Albany (57/161), Salmonella Corvallis (42/161), and Salmonella Brancaster (37/161) being the predominant serovars. Conclusion: The most carcass contact and environmental samples collected along the wet market chicken processing line were consistently contaminated with Salmonella. This indicates that Salmonella has established itself in poultry processing environments by colonizing the surfaces of the equipment and survives in these environments by establishing biofilms. Our results highlight the need of implementing strict hygiene and sanitation standards to reduce the incidence of Salmonella. The prevalence of Salmonella in poultry can be reduced effectively by identifying and eliminating the sources and contamination sites during slaughter and processing of poultry.",

Despite the implementation of current food safety management systems, foodborne outbreaks linked to fresh produce continue to be reported. A microbial assessment scheme and statistical modeling were used to systematically assess the microbial performance of core control and assurance activities in five Kenyan fresh produce processing and export companies. Generalized linear mixed models and correlated random-effects joint models for multivariate clustered data followed by empirical Bayes estimates enabled the analysis of the probability of contamination across critical sampling locations (CSLs) and factories as a random effect. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in the final products. However, none of the processors attained the maximum safety level for environmental samples. Escherichia coli was detected in five of the six CSLs, including the final product. Among the processing-environment samples, the hand or glove swabs of personnel revealed a higher level of predicted contamination with E. coli, and 80% of the factories were E. coli positive at this CSL. End products showed higher predicted probabilities of having the lowest level of food safety compared with raw materials. The final products were E. coli positive despite the raw materials being E. coli negative for 60% of the processors. There was a higher probability of contamination with coliforms in water at the inlet than in the final rinse water. Four (80%) of the five assessed processors had poor to unacceptable counts of Enterobacteriaceae on processing surfaces. Personnel-, equipment-, and product-related hygiene measures to improve the performance of preventive and intervention measures are recommended.",

		"abstract": "This study reports the hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) and microbiological qualities of seafood products as affected by hygiene of handlers in Ibadan and Lagos, Nigeria. Seafood products were purchased at four different processing plants, two each from Ibadan and Lagos. This study consisted of observing the raw materials, water used, the utensils used and the environment, monitoring all steps of the processing and packaging, recording temperatures during preparation, storage and display and collecting samples of seafood products for total viable counts, coliforms, Salmonella and Shigella counts and fungi counts. A microbiological survey of seafood processors/handlers was also performed. Palms of processors/handlers were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of indicator organisms of sanitary quality. The total viable bacteria count decreased with time from raw to packaging and to when ready for consumption. Coliforms, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp, and fungi were isolated and had count higher than 103 cells/ml before processing and after processing with few exceptions. A total of 186 organisms were isolated and identified. Almost all palms of the handlers sampled haboured Micrococcus sp. [36(21.1%)] and Enterobacter sp. [30(18.0%)], followed by Bacillus sp. [24 (14.0%)], Flavobacterium sp. [19 (11.1%)], Staphylococcus sp. [17(9.9%)], Escherichia coli [15(8.8%)], Proteus sp. [8(4.7%)], Salmonella sp. [7(4.1%)], Citrobacter sp [3(1.8%)],Klebsiella sp [4(2.3%)], Pseudomonas sp. [3(1.8%)], Serratia sp. [3(1.8%)] and Achromobacterium sp [2(1.2%)], Aspergillus formigatus [3(20.0%)], Aspergillus niger [2(13.3%)], Fusarium sp [2(13.3%)], Mucor mucido [3(20.0%)], Neurospora crassa [2(13.3%)] and Rhizopus sp [3(20.0%)]. Seafood processors/handlers may be sources of microbial chance inoculation, microbial food poison, food intoxication and food spoilage hence, processors/handlers may be counter productive by being responsible for public health hazard and loss of revenue. The level of counts appears high for processed and unprocessed products; the presence of coliforms, S. aureus, B. Cereus, Salmonella and fungi showed that processing of these seafood products in a highly contaminated environment and holding at frozen temperature for sale could be risky. Using current WHO/FAO/NAFDAC guidelines and standards for foods and water, none of the food processors/handlers, the utensils and the products were within acceptable standards. There were significant correlations between bacteriological quality and food hygiene training, and waste product management polices. The findings of this study suggests that there is need to improve on hygienic practices as well as HACCP implementation in public food service outlets in order to obtain relatively safe processed seafood products for consumption. The new approach to supervision of food hygiene and sanitary quality, the HACCP system works rationally as it is based on analysis of systematically assembled data on the causes and conditions which evoked the illness of the consumers by food products or meals. Therefore, education of owners of seafood processing plants, processors/handlers on hazards, critical control points and the importance of hygienic environment is imperative. The control measures and monitoring procedures for seafood processing and packaging are thus advocated.",

This review discusses the ingredients used and processing of OL aw products with a view to provide greater understanding of the routes of their contamination with foodborne pathogens and factors influencing pathogen persistence in these foods. Adequate heat treatment during processing may eliminate bacterial pathogens from OL aw foods; however, post-processing contamination commonly occurs. Once these products are contaminated, their high fat and sugar content can enhance pathogen survival for long periods. The physiological basis and survival mechanisms used by pathogens in these products are comprehensively discussed here. Foodborne outbreaks and recalls linked to OL aw foods are summarized and it was observed that serotypes of Salmonella enterica were the predominant pathogens causing illnesses. Further, intervention strategies available to control foodborne pathogens such as thermal inactivation, use of natural antimicrobials, irradiation and hydrostatic pressure are assessed for their usefulness to achieve pathogen control and enhance the safety of OL aw foods. Sanitation, hygienic design of manufacturing facilities, good hygienic practices, and environmental monitoring of OL aw food industries were also discussed.",

		"abstract": "Introduction. Testing for Listeria and Salmonella in foods is an essential aspect of any quality control and food safety program to minimize the risk of infection for the consumer. The availability of reliable, accurate and rapid methods to detect these pathogens is increasingly important for the food industry. Purpose. The aim was to develop and to validate a rapid screening method that significantly minimizes the complexity and length of enrichment for PCR-based detection of Listeria and Salmonella in environmental and food samples. Methods. Actero Listeria Enrichment Media and Actero Salmonella Enrichment Media, optimized for rapid recovery of Listeria and Salmonella, were used for enriching these pathogens from environmental and food samples. Enriched samples were tested using BAX System real-time PCR assays. For Listeria, seven internal studies and one external validation study were conducted that included 240 environmental (stainless steel, plastic and sealed concrete) and 240 food (hot dog, bagged fresh spinach, frozen cooked shrimp and soft Mexican-style cheese) samples. For Salmonella, five internal and two external validation studies were completed and included 240 environmental (stainless steel and plastic) and 240 food (dry pet food, chocolate liquor and milk chocolate) samples. The alternative detection methods were compared to the appropriate reference methods. The results were evaluated using the AOAC Probability of Detection statistical model. Results. No false negative or false positive results were observed after enriching at 35°C for 20-26 hours for Listeria spp. and 14-22 hours for Salmonella spp. The detection of Listeria and Salmonella in environmental and food samples enriched with the proposed media using the real-time PCR assays showed equal or better performance as compared to the gold standard methods. Significance. These alternative methods were determined to be reliable, accurate, and faster than other methods for detection of Listeria and Salmonella.",

This study was conducted to assess the sanitary and hygienic conditions of a meat plant based on total bacterial counts, E. coli, group D streptococci, and Salmonella counts on selected machines, in cured meats not treated thermally, and in marjoram. The bacterial counts varied regardless of the season of the year. The presence of bacteria on the equipment used for production of cured meats was conducive to its bacteriological contamination. This was confirmed by the isolation of the lowest E. coli and enterococci counts from the cured meats analysed in the winter period, when the lowest contamination of the equipment with these microorganisms was also noted. Throughout the entire study period, no Salmonella rods were isolated either on the equipment or in cured meats and marjoram. The bacteriological contamination of the hard-to-disinfect equipment should be treated as a critical area when implementing quality control using the HACCAP method.",

		"abstract": "The effects of existing food safety management systems and size of the production facility on microbiological quality in the dairy industry in Kenya were studied. A microbial assessment scheme was used to evaluate 14 dairies in Nairobi and its environs, and their performance was compared based on their size and on whether they were implementing hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) systems and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22000 recommendations. Environmental samples from critical sampling locations, i.e., workers' hands and food contact surfaces, and from end products were analyzed for microbial quality, including hygiene indicators and pathogens. Microbial safety level profiles (MSLPs) were constructed from the microbiological data to obtain an overview of contamination. The maximum MSLP score for environmental samples was 18 (six microbiological parameters, each with a maximum MSLP score of 3) and that for end products was 15 (five microbiological parameters). Three dairies (two large scale and one medium scale; 21% of total) achieved the maximum MSLP scores of 18 for environmental samples and 15 for the end product. Escherichia coli was detected on food contact surfaces in three dairies, all of which were small scale dairies, and the microorganism was also present in end product samples from two of these dairies, an indication of cross-contamination. Microbial quality was poorest in small scale dairies. Most operations in these dairies were manual, with minimal system documentation. Noncompliance with hygienic practices such as hand washing and cleaning and disinfection procedures, which is common in small dairies, directly affects the microbial quality of the end products. Dairies implementing HACCP systems or ISO 22000 recommendations achieved maximum MSLP scores and hence produced safer products.",

A total of 270 samples were collected: mixture of ground pork meat and fat, products at the end of acidification, sausages at the end of ripening and, during production stages, surfaces in contact with meat and surfaces not in contact with meat. For samples of ground meat, product at the end of acidification and sausages at the end of ripening, the pH and water activity (aw), were determined. All the samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella. Thirtytwo Salmonella isolates were obtained, subjected to serotyping and PFGE. The sausages at the end of ripening pH and aw mean values were 5.390.24 and 0.910.03, respectively. Salmonella was detected in three processing plants with an overall prevalence of 16.7% in food samples and 5.8% in environmental samples. Salmonella prevalence was 24% in ground meat and products at the end of acidification and was also detected in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening (2%). In environmental samples, Salmonella was detected in 6.6% of surfaces in contact with meat and 5% of surfaces not in contact with meat. Five serotypes were identified among 32 isolates: S. Derby (37.5%), S. Typhimurium and S. Rissen (both 25%), S. Give and monophasic S. Typhimurium (both 6.25%). Six different pulsotypes were obtained with PFGE. The serotypes and the PFGE pattern of the strains were specific for each facility with no overlapping between different processing plants. The same observation can be pointed out considering different sampling days for the same processing plants, thus presumably indicating the raw material (ground pork meat and fat) as the source of contamination. The detection of Salmonella in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening highlights the ability of the pathogen to survive during manufacturing process.",

Moreover, aerobic colony count [total viable count (TVC); ISO 4833] and Enterobacteriaceae (ISO 21528-2) of piglets and finishing pigsâ carcasses were evaluated, and the results compared with EU process hygiene criteria (Reg. EC 2073/2005). Salmonella was not isolated in any of the piglets samples. Prevalence differed between slaughterhouses (P<0.5), and Salmonella was isolated from 39 of 244 samples of finishing slaughtered pigs (15.9%) and from 4 of 45 environmental samples (8.9%). In pig samples, carcasses showed the highest prevalence (18%) followed by colon content (14.8%), lymph nodes (13%) and liver (1.6%). S. Anatum was the most prevalent serotype (71.8%), followed by S. Derby (33.3%), S. Bredeney (5%) and S. Holcomb (2.5%). Between environmental samples, S. Anatum (50%), S. Bredeney and S. Derby (25%) were identified. Total viable mean counts (logââ CFU/cmÂ²) of carcass surfaces ranged from 4.6 and 5.7 for piglets, and from 4.6 and 5.9 for finishing pigs, while Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 1.1 and 5 for piglets and between 2.1 and 5.3 for finishing pigs. These results were not in compliance with EU performance criteria. Total aerobic viable counts and Enterobacteriaceae mean levels of environmental samples appeared critical, particularly referred to surfaces in contact with meat (splitting equipment) and indicated an inadequate application of good manufacturing and hygiene practices during slaughtering and sanitisation.",

		"abstract": "12 Styrian meat processing plants were monitored for Salmonella between April and November 1999 as part of the Styrian Salmonella surveillance programme in pork production. On the basis of a representative sampling plan, 1920 swab samples (60 samples taken before and after cutting and 40 from cutting surfaces) were subjected to 2 series of bacteriological examinations for Salmonella. Salmonella was detected in 7 samples taken before cutting (n=720), in 1 sample taken after cutting (n=720) and in 1 swab sample collected from cutting surfaces (n=480). The extrapolation from the random samples to the population of pork produced and cut in Syria showed the estimated average proportion of Salmonella contaminated pork to be 0.15%. The results were corroborated by serological examination of meat juices by ELISA. It is concluded that there is no urgent need for control programmes in Styrian breeding and finishing establishments and consistent bacteriological Salmonella monitoring in the cutting area should allow reaction to any deterioration by immediately taking appropriate countermeasures.",

The assay utilizes a PCR detection method coupled with a rapid, visual, flow-based assay that develops in 3 min post-PCR amplification and requires only an 18 h enrichment for maximum sensitivity. The Veriflow SS system eliminates the need for sample purification, gel electrophoresis, or fluorophore-based detection of target amplification and does not require complex data analysis. This Performance Tested MethodSM validation study demonstrated the ability of the Veriflow SS method to detect low levels of artificially inoculated or naturally occurring Salmonella spp. in eight distinct environmental and food matrixes. In each reference comparison study, probability of detection analysis indicated that there was no significant difference between the Veriflow SS method and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook Chapter 4.06 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual Chapter 5 reference methods. A total of 104 Salmonella strains were detected in the inclusivity study, and 35 nonspecific organisms went undetected in the exclusivity study. The study results show that the Veriflow SS method is a sensitive, selective, and robust assay for the presumptive detection of Salmonella spp. sampled from environmental surfaces (stainless steel, sealed concrete, plastic, and ceramic tile), dairy (2% milk), raw meat (20% fat ground beef), chicken carcasses, and RTE food (hot dogs).",

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Escherichiacoli O157:H7, Listeria spp., L.monocytogenes and Salmonella was determined for cattle hides, carcasses and environmental samples over the course of 5 months at 2 large beef processing plants, A and B, located in the southern and northern United States, respectively. The prevalence of E.coli O157:H7 (68.1 vs. 55.9%) and Salmonella (91.8 vs. 50.3%) was higher (P < 0.05), and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (37.7 vs. 75.5%) and L.monocytogenes (0.8 vs. 18.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the hides of cattle slaughtered at plant A vs. plant B. Similarly, the prevalence of Salmonella (52.0 vs. 25.3%) was higher (P < 0.05) and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (12.0 vs. 40.0%) and L.monocytogenes (1.3 versus 14.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the fence panels of the holding pens of plant A vs. plant B. The prevalence of E.coli O157:H7 (3.1 vs. 10.9%), Listeria spp. (4.5 vs. 14.6%), and L.monocytogenes (0.0 vs. 1.1%) was lower (P < 0.05) for pre-evisceration carcasses sampled at plant A vs. plant B. Salmonella (both plants), Listeria spp. (plant B), and L. monocytogenes (plant B) were detected on fabrication floor conveyor belts (product contact surfaces) late during the production day. For plant B, 21 of 148 (14.2%) late-operational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples were L. monocytogenes positive. For plant B, E.coli O157:H7 and L.monocytogenes were detected in pre-operational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples. Overall, results suggest that there are regional differences in the prevalence of pathogens on the hides of cattle processed at commercial beef processing plants. However, it is further suggested that while hide data may reflect the regional prevalence of pathogens, the carcass data is indicative of differences in practices and procedures in these plants.",

		"abstract": "Background: Salmonella is a Gram-negative bacterium and the principal cause of human gastroenteritis that originates from the consumption of animal products. Objective: to determine serotype and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella spp. isolated from pork meat and environmental samples in 6 slaughterhouses and 14 butcheries in Tolima, Colombia. Methods: slaughterhouses and butcheries were selected depending on their slaughter capacity and compliance with good manufacturing practices. Samples (n=507) were taken from carcasses, the environment, and fomites (i.e., surfaces of knives, hooks, floor, siphons, work surfaces, and transport trucks), then cultured in Salmonella selective media. Following this, the isolated Salmonella spp. was identified using a conventional biochemical test and genus antiserum (Poli A+Vi). The Kauffman-Whyte scheme was used for serotyping and the agar diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer) was used to determine antibiotic sensitivity. Results: Manhattan, Derby, Typhimurium, Javiana, Muenster, Hvittingfoss, Sinsfort, Kattbus, and Saint Paul serotypes of Salmonella were isolated from both pork meat and environmental samples, being Derby the most common serotype. Salmonella isolates showed antibiotic multiresistance mainly to tetracycline, lincomycin and nalidixic acid. Conclusions: several Salmonella serotypes are present in slaughterhouses and meat samples from butcheries, and they show similar antibiotic resistance patterns. This work represents the first report on Salmonella serotypes in slaughterhouses and pork meat from butcheries in Tolima, Colombia.",

		"abstract": "An outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Agona infections associated with nationwide distribution of cereal from Company X was identified in April 2008. This outbreak was detected using PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, which coincided with Company X's voluntary recall of unsweetened puffed rice and wheat cereals after routine product sampling yielded Salmonella Agona. A case patient was defined as being infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona, with illness onset from 1 January through 1 July 2008. Case patients were interviewed using a standard questionnaire, and the proportion of ill persons who reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal was compared with Company X's market share data using binomial testing. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture inspected the cereal production facility and collected both product and environmental swab samples. Routine surveillance identified 33 case patients in 17 states. Of 32 patients interviewed, 24 (83%) reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal. Company X puffed rice cereal represented 0.063% of the total ready-to-eat dry cereal market share in the US at the time of the investigation. Binomial testing suggested that the proportion of exposed case patients would not likely occur by chance (P < 0.0001). Of 17 cereal samples collected from case patient homes for laboratory testing, 2 (12%) yielded Salmonella Agona indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. 12 environmental swabs and 9 product samples from the cereal plant yielded the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona. Company X cereal was implicated in a similar outbreak of Salmonella Agona infection in 1998 with the same outbreak strain linked to the same production facility. We hypothesize that a recent construction project at this facility created an open wall near the cereal production area allowing reintroduction of Salmonella Agona into the product, highlighting the resilience of Salmonella in dry food production environments.",

		"abstract": "This study deals with the occurrence of thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella in a sheep slaughterhouse in Brandenburg, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate, how these zoonotic agents are distributed within the slaughterhouse and the processing line. Simultaneously, an interrelation between slaughterhouse and the relevant sheep farms was to investigate. Investigations were carried out from July 2008 to August 2009. A total of 423 samples was obtained from 14 excursions. 320 samples using excision method at four process positions of the line, five points of the carcass (before depelting, after depelting, after evisceration and at chilling) and 103 environmental swab samples (floor of the lairage stable floor, fleece depelting machine, deposition board of carcasses after removing the fleece, doorknobs as well as wall of the chilling room and knifes) were collected. The excision samples were analysed for Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae Count (EC) and all samples qualitative for Campylobacter, Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella and Yersinia. Campylobacter and E. coli isolates were characterized by PFGE (Kpn I enzyme) and PCR respectively. Results: Hygiene: For excision samples the mean APC (log10 CFU/cm2) was 3.79, the mean EC (log10 CFU/cm2) was 1.58. An increase in the number of bacteria during the process untill chilling was observed (process position 4). The microbiological carriage of the carcasses for APC and EB was significantly different depending upon the process position. Zoonotic agents: Thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria spp. and E. coli were identified with an average of 20.1%, 11.1% and 60.1% of all samples respectively. Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella were not found in any sample here. Campylobacter was detected in 20.1% (85 of 423) by conventional technique, the highest detection rate was obtained in samples from lairage stable floor samples (68.2%). Campylobacter was not detected in sterilisation bassins, at doorknobs or on the walls in the chilling room. The highest findings on the carcasses was in the chilling room (27.5%) (process position 4). The Campylobacter isolates were differentiated using conventional and PCR technique: C. jejuni (71.3%/55.7%), C. coli (23.8%/11.4%) and C. lari (5.0%/14.8%) were detected. Listeria was detected in 11.1% (47 of 423) of samples, mostly in samples from lairage stable floor samples (27.3%). Listeria was not detected in sterilisation bassins, on doorknobs, at the wall in the chilling room or on the deposition board of carcasses after depelting. The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found before depelting (12.5%) and in the chilling room (12.5%). Listeria isolates were L. ivanovii (57.4%; 27 of 47), L. denitrificans (27.7%; 13 of 47), L. monocytogenes (8.5; 4 out of 47%) and L. innocua (2.1%; 1 of 47) were found. E. coli was detected in 60.1% (254 of 423) of all samples, most of them were from the samples of the lairage stable floor and fleece depelting machine (100.0% each). The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found in the chilling room (72.5%). For Campylobacter isolates using PFGE, a relationship between some sample qualities was observed: Within particular excursions and also for different ones, the patterns of PFGE indicate the same genetic sequences of Campylobacter. Hence, transfer of Campylobacter from farm in to the slaughterhouse and the meat production process can not be excluded. In conclusion, thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria and E. coli were identified on carcasses and in environmental samples especially in the lairage stable floor samples. A transfer of these pathogens from the farms to the slaughterhouse can be assumed.",

The various microbiological parameters evaluated were total aerobic plate count (TAPC) at 22° and 35° C, total and faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, mould and yeasts and Salmonella. A total of 634 samples was collected at different critical control points during these sanitary surveys in 1976-1977. Contamination of the working surfaces in various plants varied from 106 to 108/77 cm2 for the TAPC at 22° and 35° C; 104 to 105 for yeasts and moulds; 103 to 105 for total coliform and 103 for faecal streptococci, while only a few faecal coliform and Salmonella were isolated. Samples at the broiler plant showed an initial level of Salmonella of 76.9%. Surfaces of beef carcasses at the packing plants were also monitored; the TAPC fluctuated from 104 to 109/77 cm2. This high level of contamination could contribute to the high bacterial counts on the working surfaces. At time of sampling, every plant was inspected, the results of the latest sanitary survey discussed, and improved cleaning and disinfection techniques were suggested. The level of contamination was reduced considerably, as evidenced after the final sanitary survey which showed a 1000 fold decrease in TAPC. Salmonella positives decreased to 4.5% at the broiler slaughtering plant. It is concluded that is possible, with good manufacturing practices and appropriate cleaning and sanitizing procedures, to maintain low microbial levels on equipment and working surfaces.",

The results showed that, independent of factory and animal type, the meat itself was the site where the highest frequency of positive cases of contamination by S. aureus, E. coli and coliforms was found. Moreover the meat contact surfaces such as cutting boards, cutting blocks and meat containers were the environmental sites showing the highest percentage of positive cases.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to show the distribution of Salmonella in slaughtered pigs and the environment of the slaughterhouse in Netherlands. 1114 samples of slaughtered pigs (6 different samples for Salmonella isolation and one serum sample for ELISA on antibodies per pig) and 477 samples of the slaughterhouse environment were collected in 2 slaughterhouses on 2 sampling days per slaughterhouse. Salmonella was isolated from one or more samples of 47% of the pigs. The highest prevalence of Salmonella was observed in rectal content samples (25.6%), whereas the lowest prevalence of Salmonella was observed on the carcasses (1.4%). The prevalence of Salmonella in other samples was: 19.6% in tonsils, 9.3% on livers, 9.3% on tongues and 9.3% in mesenteric lymph nodes. The prevalence of Salmonella in environmental samples was high in the drain water samples in both slaughterhouses (61%) and on the carcass splitter in one slaughterhouse (33%). S. typhimurium was the most frequently isolated serotype in pig samples and environmental samples in both slaughterhouses: 43% of the Salmonella isolates from pigs and 33% from the environment was S. typhimurium. The results of this study show that Salmonella prevalences in pigs differ a lot, depending on which part of the pig is sampled. Not all different samples of the pig will become available for human consumption, but collecting more than one sample per pig showed that Salmonella can be found in almost the whole pig. The result of surface samples of carcass and liver gives information about hygiene during the slaughter process; the result of tonsils, lymph nodes and rectal contents, combined with the serological result, gives information about infection of the pig before the slaughter process (on the farm, during transport or in lairage). It can be concluded that results of Salmonella isolation of slaughter pigs should always be carefully interpreted, depending on the type of sample that has been collected.",

Sporadic contamination by pathogenic microflora was recorded. Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were detected in 4.8% and 6.7% of the samples, respectively, and Staphylococcus aureus was enumerated in 6.1% of the samples. Several critical points were identified, such as the machines for S. aureus and the tables and the knives for L. monocytogenes; this knowledge is crucial for the improvement of hygiene control systems in small and traditional meat processing industries. The variability of the residual contamination emphasized the different cleaning, disinfecting and manufacturing practices routinely followed by these small-scale processing units.

We performed a matched case-control study, environmental investigation and detailed traceback of food purchases to identify the source of the outbreak. In the case-control study, cases were found to be more likely than controls to have consumed a ready-to-eat salad mix (matched odds ratio 20, 95% confidence interval 2.7-). By traceback of purchases one brand of ready-to-eat salad was indicated, but all environmental samples were negative for Salmonella. This outbreak underlines that pre-washed and bagged salads carry a risk of infection despite thorough cleaning procedures by the importer. To further reduce the risk of infection by consumption of ready-to-eat salads product quality should be ensured by importers. Outbreaks linked to salads reinforce the importance of implementation of appropriate food safety management systems, including good practices in lettuce production.",

The egg industry is implementing a variety of practices, in addition to those required by regulation, to help reduce the number of SE illnesses. To characterize food safety practices in the egg industry, this study conducted a national mail survey of egg packing and egg products plants. 201 surveys were received from egg packing plants and 60 surveys from egg products plants. The survey collected information on use of specific food safety practices and technologies, microbiological testing practices and employee food safety training. Many plants have adopted food safety practices not required by current regulations. For example, in the egg packing industry, 67% of eggs are transported from the farm to the plant at or below 45°F, and 52% of eggs are stored for less than 1 day at the plant. Most egg products plants conduct voluntary microbiological testing (80% of plants) and environmental sampling (73%). Furthermore, half of egg packing plants and 80% of egg products plants have a written self-reported, non-regulatory HACCP plan. The survey findings, along with other data, can be used to characterize current industry practices prior to promulgation of HACCP regulations.",

		"abstract": "To learn how meat and poultry processors promote food safety, a nationally representative mail survey of processing plants (944 completed surveys, 66% response rate) was conducted. Plants employ a variety of sanitation and other food safety practices to control Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria and other pathogens. Most plants sanitize hand tools during operations (89%) and treat drains with sanitizers for pathogen control (84%). About 64% of plants have purchase specifications to control pathogens in raw meat and poultry. However, less than one-third of plants apply antimicrobial chemicals. 71% of plants conduct voluntary microbiological testing, and 70% conduct environmental sampling. Analysis by HACCP size suggests that large and small plants are more likely than very small plants to use many types of food safety practices and technologies (P < 0.01). Furthermore, plants that produce ready-to-eat products or inputs to further processing are more likely than plants with no such production to use some types of food safety practices and technologies. These findings can be used to establish a baseline of current industry practices, to conduct analyses of plant practices that might contribute to risk-based inspection initiatives, and to conduct required economic analyses of proposed regulations.",

		"abstract": "Poultry processing plants in the United States were surveyed on their current Campylobacter and Salmonella control practices. Following surveys, data were collected to develop a baseline for prevalence rates of Salmonella and Campylobacter; then changes in practices were implemented and evaluated for improvements in pathogen control. Surveys were sent to the plant Quality Assurance managers to determine production levels, antimicrobial interventions, and current pathogen testing practices. Initial sampling was performed at 6 plants with similar production volumes, at sites that included carcass samples before any pre-evisceration intervention, after exiting the inside-outside bird washer (IOBW), after exiting the pre-chiller, after exiting the primary chiller, and after exiting any post-chill intervention, as well as a water sample from each scalder, pre-chiller, primary chiller, and post-chill dip tank or finishing chiller. Enumerations and enrichments were performed for Campylobacter and Salmonella. Following the baseline sampling, changes in practices were suggested for each plant and a second sampling was conducted to determine their effectiveness. Results demonstrated that peracetic acid (PAA) was the most effective (P< 0.05) antimicrobial currently in use. The use of a post-chill antimicrobial immersion tank and/or use of a cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) spray cabinet also displayed a further reduction in microbial levels (P< 0.05) when the primary chiller was not sufficient (P> 0.05). Microbial buildup in the immersion tanks demonstrates the need for effective cleaning, sanitation practices, and chiller maintenance to reduce contamination of poultry with Campylobacter and Salmonella. © 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.",

A total of 636 samples were collected; Salmonella was laboratory-confirmed from 154/441 (34.9%) carcass swab-samples, 13/57 (22.8%) pieces of equipment, 30/86 (34.9%) environmental samples and the intestinal contents of 19/52 (36.5%) animals. Salmonella was found to be at its highest and lowest frequency during splitting (55.9%) and flaming (17.2%) processes, respectively. All Salmonella isolates were characterized by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and 69 S. Derby isolates were analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four serovars (S. Derby, S. Rissen, S. Typhimurium, and S. London) were shared from the four sources and predominant serovars were S. Derby and S. Rissen. MLST results indicated that ten different STs were distinguished, of which ST40 was identified as the most prominent ST. Moreover, ST40, ST469, ST34 and ST155 comprised Salmonella isolates obtained from carcass, equipment, the slaughterhouse environment and intestinal contents. PFGE results showed that 33 pulsotypes (PF1-PF33) were identified. PF21, PF25 and PF29 suggested that many isolates from carcass-swab samples at different slaughterhouse process points were of the same pulsotype which also partly comprised isolates from equipment, the environment and intestinal contents. The present study provides an insight into Salmonella distribution in a pig slaughterhouse and revealed that cross-contamination occurs frequently at different sites, which provides data support for proposing some interventions to control Salmonella.",

		"abstract": "The air in 7 Minnesota turkey processing plants was analysed microbiologically for total numbers of bacteria/ft3, number of coliform organisms/ft3, and the presence of salmonellae. Environmental samples (walls, floors, and equipment adjacent to air sampling areas) also were tested for the presence of salmonellae. Areas sampled included: live bird area (hanging, stunning, killing), scald and picking areas, evisceration line, packaging line, and further processing. Total numbers of bacteria in the air of 1 plant ranged from >200 000/ft3 in the live bird area to 1/ft3 near the evisceration line. Coliform numbers in the air of a second plant ranged from 400/ft3 in the live bird area to 0/100 ft3 in the other areas of the plant. Similar results were obtained in the other plants. Salmonellae were found in the air of the live bird area in 6 of the 7 plants and in the picking room of the other one. In each of the 7 plants salmonellae were not recovered from the air in other processing areas. The data indicate that salmonellae are frequently found in the air where live birds are handled but are difficult to isolate or find in other areas of the plant.",

		"abstract": "Food-borne microorganisms are major pathogens affecting food safety and cause human illness worldwide as a result of consumption of foodstuff, mainly animal products contaminated with vegetative pathogens or their toxins. Most of these microbes have zoonotic importance resulting in significant impact on both public health and economic sectors. Bacteria are the causative agents of two-thirds of human food-borne diseases worldwide with high burden in developing countries. Hence, the objectives of this review paper are to highlight the background of food-borne bacterial pathogens and to review common major food-borne zoonotic bacterial pathogens. Food animals are the major reservoirs of many food-borne zoonotic bacterial pathogens, and food products of animal origin are the main vehicles of transmission. Meat, dairy products, and eggs are the main ways by which people are exposed to zoonotic bacteria. S. aureus, Salmonella species, Campylobacter species, L. monocytogenes, and E. coli are the major zoonotic bacterial pathogens which are the causative agents of food-borne illness and death in the world associated with consumption of contaminated animal products. Production of toxins and structural virulent factors are responsible for the pathogenesis of these bacteria. These major zoonotic bacteria cause human infections which are characterized mainly by gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and other agent-specific symptoms. Some bacteria may cause severe complications. Conventional (culturing), serological, and molecular techniques are important for detection of these common zoonotic bacteria and their toxins in food. Good hygiene, GMP, sanitation in operating procedures, and implementation of standardized HACCP and pasteurization procedures are effective methods for the control and prevention. Currently, the emergence of multidrug-resistant zoonotic bacteria associated with consumption of contaminated animal products is a great concern for the public health, and there should be coordinated surveillance and monitoring system for food-borne zoonotic bacterial pathogens particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia.",

In Europe and in the USA, Salmonella and Campylobacter are the two main bacterial causes because of their presence in the intestinal tract of poultry, pig and beef. For the monitoring of the bacterial contamination of food, the enumeration of certain groups or species of bacteria of intestinal origin is an alternative to the detection of the pathogenic microorganisms. They can be used as index indicating the possible presence of pathogenic agents having a similar ecology, or as indicators announcing the non-observance of the good practices. The most used are the total plate counts, E. coli and the Enterobacteriaceae. During meat production, they are counted at the level of environment, along the food chain, on carcasses at the slaughterhouse, on carcasses and in meat, in plants and distribution. Various surveys are carried out by the producers of food and the authorities for the control of the auto-control, the national inspection plans or to determine the national baseline.",

Many pathogens, such as Salmonella, due to their enhanced thermal resistance in dry environments, can survive the drying process and may persist for prolonged periods in low-moisture foods, especially when stored in refrigerated environments. Bacterial contamination of low-moisture foods, such as peanut butter, present a vexing challenge to food safety, and especially now, in the wake of widely publicized food safety related events, food processors urgently need up-to-date, practical information on proven measures for containing the risk of contamination. While much has been written on the subject, until now it was scattered throughout the world literature in scientific and industry journals. The need for a comprehensive treatment of the subject has never been greater, and now this book satisfies that need. Discusses a wide variety of foods and evaluates multiple processing platforms from the standpoint of process validation of all food safety objectives for finished food products * Takes a practical approach integrating the latest scientific and technological advances in a handy working resource * Presents all known sources and risk factors for pathogenic bacteria of concern in the manufacturing environment for low-moisture/water activity products * Characterizes the persistence and thermal resistance of bacterial pathogens in both the environment and most low-moisture food products * Control of Salmonella and Other Bacterial Pathogens in Low-Moisture Foods is a much-needed resource for food microbiologists and food industry scientists, as well as managers and executives in companies that produce and use low-moisture foods. It also belongs on the reference shelves of food safety regulatory agencies worldwide.",

		"abstract": "A study was undertaken between 18 September and 17 November to determine the microbiological status of surfaces used in the preparation of ready-to-eat foods, and to assess cleaning standards and practices in food premises in the UK. A total of 6533 environmental samples were examined from 1502 catering (such as restaurants, cafes, and sandwich bars) or retail premises (such as butchers, delicatessens, and bakers): 2033 samples from chopping/cutting boards, 2009 from worktop surfaces, 1359 from food containers, and 1132 from cleaning cloths. Cleaning cloths were more heavily contaminated with bacteria (Aerobic Colony Count (ACC), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) compared to surfaces sampled. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 2 (0.2%) and Salmonella spp. from one (0.1%) of the cleaning cloths. Surfaces that were visually dirty, wet, last cleaned over 24 hours ago, and boards that were scored or damaged were found to have higher levels of bacteria. A hazard analysis system was in place in most (70%) food premises visited, and in 52% it was documented. Most managers (89%) had received some form of food hygiene training. Documented cleaning schedules and cleaning records were only present in approximately half (55% and 44%, respectively) of the premises. Most did not have separate implements for cleaning raw and ready-to-eat food areas (67%), or stored cleaning equipment for high risk (ready-to-eat food) areas away from those used in low risk (raw, non ready-to-eat food) areas (70%). Deficiencies in the correct use of cleaning products, such as the minimum contact time for disinfectants, were identified. Surface samples (chopping/cutting boards, worktops, and food containers) and cleaning cloths with ACC levels in excess of 103 cfu/cm2, swab or ml were associated with premises that did not have management food hygiene training, hazard analysis, cleaning schedules or cleaning records in place, and with little or no confidence in the food business management of food hygiene as indicated by Local Authority Inspectors' Confidence in Management scores.",

One hundred forty five samples consisting of whole chickens, chicken cuts and environmental samples were analysed for the presence of Salmonella. 133 (91.7%), 124 (85.5%) and 123 (84.8%) samples were positive by the culture-based method, 3M MDA and 3M Petrifilm SALX System, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy for the 3M MDA were 93.2, 91.7, 55.0, 99.2 and 93.1%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy for the 3M Petrifilm SALX System were 92.5, 100.0, 54.5, 100.0 and 93.1%, respectively. Both 3M MDA and 3M Petrifilm SALX System yielded similar kappa results, indicating substantial agreement with the culture-based method. The data from this study therefore supports the use of the 3M Petrifilm SALX System and the 3M MDA as rapid and reliable screening methods for Salmonella detection in poultry and its processing environment.

		"abstract": "Background: This study was conducted to examine the frequency of contamination in retail meat available in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology: Raw meat samples (250) and surface swabs (90) from meat processing equipment and the surrounding environment were analyzed for microbiological contamination. Results: Out of 340 samples, 84% were found to be contaminated with bacterial species, including Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. A total of 550 (66%) of the bacterial isolates were potential pathogens. Of these, 342 and 208 isolates were from meat and environmental samples respectively. Food-borne pathogens isolated from meat samples included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria, Salmonella Enteritidis and Shigella species whereas environmental samples yielded Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella species. Four strains of Brucella species were also isolated from meat samples. Total aerobic counts ranged between 108-1010 CFU/g or cm2. Resistance to a wide range of antibiotics was observed. Resistance rates to ampicillin, amoxicillin, novobiocin and cefaclor were from 62 to 75% in general. Thirty-three percent of Salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin. No quinolone resistance was observed. Biofilm formation was observed among 88 (16%) pathogenic bacteria including E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusions: Food-borne pathogens found in retail shops could be sources for horizontal contamination of meat. Our data confirm the circulation of antibiotic resistant and biofilm forming pathogens in raw meat and its environment in retail shops in Pakistan, which could play a role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance amongst food-borne bacteria.",

		"abstract": "Meat products may be vehicles of bacterial pathogens to humans. In this study, we determined both hygienic-sanitary risk and microbiological quality of raw ground beef and meat contact surfaces in butcher shops from Neuquen Province, Argentina. The hygienic-sanitary risk of the butcher shops was characterized based on the quantitative results of a checklist. A total of 44 raw ground meat and 49 meat contact surfaces were sampled. Most butcher shops presented low/moderate hygienic-sanitary risk, and one had high-risk. Counts of indicator microorganisms in ground meat samples were as follows: mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, 6.6 log CFU/g; S. aureus, 1.1 log CFU/g; E. coli, 1.5 log CFU/g. Pathogen microorganisms were found in 15.9% of ground beef samples (Salmonella spp., 6.8%; E. coli O157:H7, 2.3%; non-O157 STEC, 6.8%) and 28.6% of environmental samples (Salmonella spp., 6.1%; non-O157 STEC, 2%; L. monocytogenes, 22.4%). Concomitantly, Salmonella spp. was detected in raw ground beef and meat contact surface samples from two butcher shops. Ribotyping of these strains revealed cross-contamination. Risk quantification was useful to identify failures in different areas of the butcher shops and recognize potential improvements to reduce the risk of pathogenic bacteria contamination of meat and ready-to-eat products.",

		"abstract": "Increasing demands for \"minimally processed\" fresh produce create a potential market niche in high-value markets for South African smallholder farmers. Fresh produce not meeting required microbiological quality criteria causes consumer health concerns and therefore limits market access. This study determined selected smallholder farmer pre-and-post-harvest practices and their potential contributions to the microbiological quality of \"minimally processed\" fresh produce and thus potential implications for market access. Survey results indicated that most smallholder farmers used animal manure as fertilizer (74%) and that their knowledge of potential contamination sources was poor. Microbiological analysis showed that a number of irrigation water samples did not meet WHO recommendations for fecal coliform levels and exceeded the South African standard for E. coli for irrigation water applied to \"minimally processed\" fresh produce. Lettuce, parsley, carrots, and spinach collected over at least 3-months were frequently of unsatisfactory quality with respect to total coliform (ranging from 130 to 79000 MPN/g) and E. coli levels (ranging from 2.2 to 49 MPN/g) according to South African Department of Health recommendations. While surfaces within the processing chain harbored E. coli, Salmonella spp. was not detected on surfaces, in fresh produce or irrigation water samples analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 155 randomly selected E. coli isolates from fresh produce and irrigation water were determined by using a disk diffusion method, showing high percentages of resistance for streptomycin (95%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (32%). In addition, the ability of E. coli isolates from fresh produce to form biofilms was shown. The identification of antibiotic-resistant and biofilm forming E. coli from fresh produce and within the production environment highlights the importance of pre-and post-harvest hygiene practices, especially if smallholder farmers intend on supplying high-value markets.",

We developed, implemented, and evaluated EMPs targeting Listeria spp. and Salmonella in nine small cheese processing facilities, including seven farmstead facilities. Individual EMPs with monthly sample collection protocols were designed specifically for each facility. Salmonella was detected in only one facility, with likely introduction from the adjacent farm indicated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data. Listeria spp. were isolated from all nine facilities during routine sampling. The overall Listeria spp. (other than Listeria monocytogenes) and L. monocytogenes prevalences in the 4,430 environmental samples collected were 6.03 and 1.35%, respectively. Molecular characterization and subtyping data suggested persistence of a given Listeria spp. strain in seven facilities and persistence of L. monocytogenes in four facilities. To assess routine sampling plans, validation sampling for Listeria spp. was performed in seven facilities after at least 6 months of routine sampling. This validation sampling was performed by independent individuals and included collection of 50 to 150 samples per facility, based on statistical sample size calculations. Two of the facilities had a significantly higher frequency of detection of Listeria spp. during the validation sampling than during routine sampling, whereas two other facilities had significantly lower frequencies of detection. This study provides a model for a science- and statistics-based approach to developing and validating pathogen EMPs.",

		"abstract": "The study was conducted from November 2015 to November 2016 to determine bacterial load and identify pathogenic bacteria (S. aureus, E. coli, and Salmonellae species) in meat from abattoir and butcher shops as well as to assess associated hygienic and sanitation practices being experienced in the selected study site. A cross-sectional study was conducted where a simple random sampling method was used to select butcher shops, and the municipal abattoir was purposively selected. A structured questionnaire survey was also used to assess hygienic status of the municipal abattoir and butcher shops. A total of 124 samples (48 swab samples from abattoir carcass, 4 samples of carcass washing water about 20 ml of each, and 36 swab samples each from butcher shop cutting table and cutting knife, respectively) were collected during the study period. The collected samples were processed for aerobic plate count, and the total mean count was found to be 4.53 log10 cfu/cm2 from abattoir carcass swab samples, 2.4 log10 cfu/ml from water samples, 6.58 log10 cfu/cm2 from butcher shops cutting table, and 6.1 log10 cfu/cm2 from cutting knife swab samples. E. coli was the dominant bacterial species isolated (35.2%), followed by S. aureus (22.5%) and Salmonellae species (9.9%). According to the questionnaire survey, 48.4% (15/31) of the abattoir workers did not receive any training regarding food safety issues. Moreover, a majority (66.67%) of the respondents of the butcher house workers were grade 1-4 (elementary) in their educational level and do not use hairnet and handle money with bare hands during serving meat to consumers. The study showed that the hygienic status of the abattoir and butcher shops in the study area is poor, and the obtained results of bacterial load are higher than the acceptable limit of the standard. Therefore, the necessary strategies towards hygiene and sanitation of meat in the town should be implemented.",

		"abstract": "During the summer of 2005, an increase in reports of human cases of Salmonella enterica serovar Ohio infection was observed in Belgium. During 11 weeks, between 1 July and 13 September, 60 cases of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Ohio infection were reported to the National Reference Centre for Salmonella, with a peak onset of symptoms in the third week of July. All clinical isolates caused self-limiting gastroenteritis; both genders (32 males and 28 females) and all age groups (three children <5 years of age, three children 5 to 14 years of age, 32 adults 15 to 64 years of age, and 22 adults >65 years of age) were affected. The isolates were distributed throughout Belgium but a cluster of several cases was observed around Brussels. At the same time, an increase in the incidence of this serovar was observed in the Salmonella isolates originating from the official surveillance campaign conducted by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, which identified pork as a likely source of the outbreak strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing confirmed the clonal relationship between the human isolates, the isolates from samples collected in the cutting plants, and the isolates from pork meat in distribution. Further epidemiological investigations indicated that one particular slaughterhouse was involved. In that slaughterhouse, the carcasses were contaminated during the evisceration process because of contaminated equipment and uncontrolled environmental conditions. This study highlights the importance of a centralized surveillance laboratory in the management of outbreaks and the need of strict implementation of hygienic rules to avoid this type of outbreak.",

		"abstract": "AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in pigs at the moment of slaughter and in the slaughterhouse environment. METHODS AND  RESULTS: In total, five different commercial slaughterhouses were sampled during  eight slaughterhouse visits. Carcass swabs, colon content and mesenteric lymph nodes  were taken to reflect the animal status and from the slaughterhouse environmental  samples were taken. Salmonella was isolated from 37% of the carcass samples as a  mean value. High variations were noticed between different slaughterhouses (between  0 and 70%) and sampling days in the same abattoir (between 3 and 52%). A correlation  was found between the carcass contamination and the status of the delivered animals  (P=0.01675). Cross contamination was estimated to account for 29% of the positive  carcasses. The slaughterhouse environment was highly contaminated; before starting  the slaughtering activities 25% of the samples were positive on average. The most  prevalent serotypes isolated at the slaughterhouse environment and from the colon  content were S. Typhimurium, S. Livingstone and S. Derby. On carcasses S.  Typhimurium was predominately isolated (71%). The biggest variability of serotypes  was found in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Serologically 56.3% of the pigs were found  positive for Salmonella using a cut-off level of the optical density percentage  higher than 10 (O.D.% > or = 10). While on individual pig level the correlation  between the bacteriological and serological data was poor, because of recent  Salmonella infections, a better correlation was found at the herd level on the  moment of slaughtering. CONCLUSION: A high degree of carcass contamination is  noticed after slaughtering. This contamination resulted from the delivery of  Salmonella-positive pigs and cross-contamination from the slaughterhouse  environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In pigs, Salmonella carriage is  high, but it is obvious that slaughterhouse hygiene is a determinative factor for  managing carcass contamination.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica in retail produce environments and to elucidate possible ecological niches. Thirty environmental samples per store were collected during daily operations monthly for six months in 30 retail produce departments across seven states. Selected samples were serially diluted and plated to determine aerobic plate count. Each sample was tested for L. monocytogenes and S. enterica using ROKA Atlas LmG2 and SEN assays, respectively. A total of 5,112 samples were tested for each pathogen. S. enterica was found during one sampling event in a single store; less than 0.1% of samples were positive overall. A total of 4.4% environmental samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was present on 8.1% of non-food contact surfaces and 1.6% of food contact surfaces tested; L. monocytogenes prevalence was highly variable among stores. Most of the positive L. monocytogenes samples were found in drains, floors, squeegees, or standing water. Genetically similar L. monocytogenes clones were found in multiple stores across multiple states. The odds of detecting L. monocytogenes increased 1.8-fold for every 1-log increase in APC (p < 0.0001). This is the first study to investigate prevalence and persistence of L. monocytogenes and S. enterica in retail produce environments. Our data suggest that some, but not all retail produce environments have high L. monocytogenes prevalence, which may cross-contaminate produce. Sites heavily contaminated with L. monocytogenes indicate potential targets for sanitation operating procedures and food safety management strategies. However, S. enterica prevalence is very low and likely due to transient contamination. Further, APC may be a cost-effective environmental monitoring tool that could indicate an environment capable of harboring L. monocytogenes..",

		"abstract": "Aims. In order to investigate Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella contamination, a survey was conducted at three peanut confectionery processing companies (A, B and C) in Brazil. Methods and results. Samples of different peanut confectionery products (n = 59), peanut raw material (n = 30), manufacturing environment (n = 116) and workers' hand surfaces (n = 12) were analysed. Salmonella and E. coli were not detected in any final product or raw material analysed. Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from 15% of final products. Coliforms were detected in only one sample. Referring to the raw material, six samples showed contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and three samples by coliforms. For the process environment, 19% and 11% of samples presented Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms. Escherichia coli was detected in 5% of samples, and one of these samples tested positive for Salmonella; this strain was serotyping as S. Heidelberg. All food handlers surveyed in Company C showed Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms on their hands. Escherichia coli was isolated from one food worker's hand. Conclusions. The results showed that the manufacturing environment, including food handlers were considered the main sources for possible contamination of peanut confectionery products. Significance and Impact of the Study. This has been the first study to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae throughout peanut confectionery processing lines. The results might be used to assist risk assessment studies and to establish more effective control measures. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.",

		"abstract": "Mitigation of risk for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Salmonella contamination was evaluated after a multiple-intervention approach (comprising food safety education and training, implementation of customized food safety practices and programs, and environmental monitoring programs with audits and corrective actions) in 2 small Honduran beef abattoirs. Previously, neither abattoir had food safety programs in place nor were they subjected to strict food safety regulatory surveillance. Abattoirs A and B were sampled on 4 nonconsecutive months each. Swab samples of abattoir A (n = 160, 40 samples per sampling date) and abattoir B (n = 78, 16-22 samples per sampling date) were taken from direct and indirect food contact surfaces, screened by BAX real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and confirmed using immunomagnetic separation, selective media, and latex agglutination. In abattoir A, Salmonella presence was negligible, whereas presumptive STECs were present in 10%, 12.5%, 0%, and 5% of the environmental samples respective to each sampling month, indicating a reduction of STEC (P = .06) by the third and fourth sampling months. Conversely, presumptive STEC presence was negligible in abattoir B, whereas Salmonella presence for each sampling month was of 5.6%, 6.3%, 27.3%, and 0.0%, respectively. Upon the increased pathogen presence detected on the third sampling month, additional actions were taken to reinforce the implementation of food safety practices and programs, which resulted in a Salmonella reduction to 0% by the fourth sampling month (P = .013). The satisfactory results strongly suggest that a multiple-intervention approach is crucial to improve food safety in this type of premises.",

Samples collected from external surfaces of cantaloupes, water, and the environments of packing sheds on cantaloupe farms were examined for the presence of Salmonella and E. coli. Of a total of 1,735 samples collected, 31 (1.8%) tested positive for Salmonella. Fifteen Salmonella serotypes were isolated from samples collected in Texas, and nine from samples collected in Colima. Two serotypes (Poona and Oranienburg) that have been associated with three large Salmonella outbreaks in the United States and Canada linked to the consumption of contaminated cantaloupe were found in water samples collected at four farms (three from the United States). Susceptibility of Salmonella isolates to 10 antimicrobials was evaluated by disk diffusion. Eighty-eight percent of the isolates from the United States and Mexico were pansusceptible to the antimicrobials tested; eight isolates from the United States demonstrated an intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin and only two isolates were resistant to the same antimicrobial. From Mexico, four isolates showed an intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin and one isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid and streptomycin. Repetitive sequence-based PCR analysis of Salmonella isolates helped to trace potential sources of Salmonella contamination in source water and in subsequent water samples obtained after the filtration systems of U.S. and Mexican cantaloupe farms. No differences could be seen between the levels of Salmonella contamination in melons from both countries.",

To address the need for industry-wide guidance, the Grocery Manufacturers Association formed a Salmonella Control Task Force to develop guidance on the control of Salmonella when manufacturing low-moisture foods. Five of the control elements were covered in previous papers: preventing ingress or spread in a facility, controlling raw materials and ingredients, adhering to stringent hygiene practices in the Primary Salmonella Control Area, following hygienic design principles, and preventing growth in the facility by control of moisture.

		"abstract": "The slaughter process plays an important role in animal welfare, meat quality, safety and public health through the meat production chain. In this study, we performed a three-stage evaluation: (I) comprehensive evaluation, (II) implementation of improvement actions and (III) verification of the success of the actions implemented in three abattoirs from Argentina during 2016-2018. Risk was estimated using two checklists, quantified on a 1-100 scale and classified as high (1-40), moderate (41-70) and low (71-100). In stages I and III, Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC were detected and isolated in samples from carcasses (n = 252), the environment (n = 252); head meat (n = 21) and viscera washing and chilling water (n = 105). Carcass samples were analyzed for mesophilic aerobic organisms, coliforms and E. coli enumeration. Of 201 water samples taken, 42.0-75.6% were non-potable quality. After the implementation of improvement actions in stage II (building, processes, systems for water purification and training), the estimation of risk of contamination was reduced from high to moderate in all three abattoirs, the count of indicator microorganisms decreased in two abattoirs, and the presence of pathogens significantly decreased. Salmonella spp. was not isolated from any of the samples collected in two abattoirs. Isolation of E. coli O157:H7 decreased in carcass and was not isolated from viscera washing and chilling water. Isolation of non-O157 STEC decreased in carcass but not in environmental samples. Finally, 75.0-95.0% of water samples were of potable quality. Although this was only the first step in the process of change and improvement of abattoirs, the assessment of the situation and the proposal of solutions to correct deviations in a joint effort with the health authorities helped to implement a work model for enhancing food safety before meat reaches consumers.",

The control of raw materials, processing and environment are critical factors in preventing microbial contamination of confectionery. Salmonella contamination is a major hazard. The organisms find their way into food through raw ingredients, faulty processing, and poor handling after processing. Testing for this organism at control points is the best means of quality control. Constant surveillance and good manufacturing practice are the best methods for prevention of contamination.",

		"abstract": "Peaches are popular, nutritious and widely consumed. Being a tree crop, it is considered a low risk fruit, with no direct water contact, and no previous foodborne disease outbreaks associated with its consumption. However, in 2014 the pioneer association between stone fruit and a foodborne illness was reported, linking Listeria monocytogenes to stone fruit. This highlights the need for better understanding of risk associated with contaminated fresh stone fruit, in order to implement adequate preventative measures. No information is available on the presence of foodborne pathogens on peaches in the supply chain. A case study approach was therefore followed to assess foodborne pathogen presence on the farm, focusing on the impact of irrigation water, facility sanitation and hygiene by collecting various fruit and environmental samples (n=428). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating basic microbial testing with safety management and risk assessment tools that can be collectively used to improve the food safety management system. No Salmonella Typhimurium was detected from samples, however, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected on fruit and environmental samples. Despite the GlobalG.A.P. certification status of the farm, livestock frequented water sources which lead to E. coli O157:H7 contamination. This conclusion was based on positive detection of foodborne pathogens from the water sources and subsequent removal of livestock which resulted in a definite decrease in pathogen detection. A number of E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus were detected during the second year of monitoring from environmental samples and it was observed that the personal hygiene and facility sanitation was not adequately enforced. Based on feedback given to the farmer, enforcement was improved and a definite decrease in foodborne pathogens was observed in the following sampling cycle. Areas of risk that were still identified following the fourth year of monitoring included the water source used for irrigation and poor sanitation in the production and processing facilities. Limited foodborne pathogen prevalence on peaches over the full study period as well as the extended export supply chain at controlled temperatures resulted in low-to-medium calculated consumer risk. The correct and meticulous implementation of integrated and holistic pre- and post-harvest food safety management systems is therefore essential to prevent produce contamination, reduce the consumer risk and therefore ensure overall product safety.",

		"abstract": "There has been a continuous rise in the number of produce-based foodborne outbreaks in the recent decades despite the perception that foodborne diseases were primarily linked to animal-based products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 95% of Salmonella-based infections originate from foodborne sources, with multiple produce-based salmonellosis outbreaks occurring since 1990. The contamination of produce in both the pre-harvest and post-harvest produce environments is challenging to eliminate since produce is consumed as a raw, fresh commodity. Salmonella spp contamination is possible through contact with the produce in the field as well as in the processing facility. The field contamination of produce infers the ability of Salmonella spp to survive on the plant surface. The fitness of Salmonella spp in the plant habitat is limited as opposed to naturally plant-associated bacteria, but survival is possible. The use of intensive farming practices, globalization of food products, high demand for convenience food products, and increased foodborne disease surveillance also have unknown ramifications in the ascending trends of produce-based outbreaks. A better understanding of the ecology of Salmonella spp in the plant environment as well as the processing, food handling and surveillance factors affecting the incidence of foodborne outbreaks will provide a comprehensive view of the etiology and epidemiology of produce-associated foodborne outbreaks. An understanding of the outbreaks and the factors facilitating produce contamination will allow for the development of intervention procedures and strategies to reduce the risk of produce contamination by Salmonella spp.",

		"abstract": "Some Enterobacteriaceae possess the ability to survive in low-moisture environments for extended periods of time. Many of the reported food-borne outbreaks associated with low-moisture foods involve Salmonella contamination. The control of Salmonella in low-moisture foods and their production environments represents a significant challenge for all food manufacturers. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge with respect to Salmonella survival in intermediate- and low-moisture food matrices and their production environments. The mechanisms utilized by this bacterium to ensure their survival in these dry conditions remain to be fully elucidated, however, in depth transcriptomic data is now beginning to emerge regarding this observation. Earlier research work described the effect(s) that low-moisture can exert on the long-term persistence and heat tolerance of Salmonella, however, data are also now available highlighting the potential cross-tolerance to other stressors including commonly used microbicidal agents. Sources and potential control measures to reduce the risk of contamination will be explored. By extending our understanding of these geno- and phenotypes, we may be able to exploit them to improve food safety and protect public health.",

We report on seven outbreaks of Salmonella Typhimurium multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) 03-26-13-08-523 (European convention 2-24-12-7-0212) in three Australian states and territories investigated between November 2015 and March 2016. We identified a common egg grading facility in five of the outbreaks. While no Salmonella Typhimurium was detected at the grading facility and eggs could not be traced back to a particular farm, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates from cases from all seven outbreaks indicated a common source. WGS was able to provide higher discriminatory power than MLVA and will likely link more Salmonella Typhimurium cases between states and territories in the future. National harmonization of Salmonella surveillance is important for effective implementation of WGS for Salmonella outbreak investigations.",

The purpose of the survey was to determine the frequency and location of certain pathogenic microorganisms in dry milk and whey processing plant environments. A total of 402 samples were collected from 18 plants by each respective plant's personnel. All plants participated on a voluntary basis in response to a request sent to all ADPI members. All 410 samples were tested for Listeria spp., 245 samples were tested for Salmonella, and 312 samples were tested for Yersinia. Of the total, five samples collected from five separate plants were positive for either Salmonella or Listeria. Two samples were positive for Listeria (one for L. monocytogenes), and three samples were positive for Salmonella. None was positive for Yersinia. Four out of the five positive samples were taken from drains in receiving, dryer, and butter production areas of the plants. The fifth positive sample was collected from a prefilter to a dryer.",

Methods: To verify the effectiveness of training provided to NRC staff, proficiency test samples consisting of ground beef inoculated with salmonellae and E. coli O157:H7 were prepared by the Proficiency Testing Unit of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and shipped to the NRC for analysis. The NRC laboratory demonstrated 100% accuracy in the identification of the target pathogens in all samples, demonstrating the successful implementation of on-site test capability. For the prevalence study, a total of 129 samples from arctic mammals, fowl, fish and environmental swabs from community freezers were analyzed at both the NRC and CFIA laboratories. Results: No E. coli O157- or Salmonella-positives were identified for any of the samples examined. Conclusion: These results represent a first step towards the creation for future reference of a database on the prevalence of the pathogens E. coli O157 and Salmonella.",

Aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts and Pseudomonas counts were performed by standard procedures and the prevalence of Listeria, presumptive Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus determined. Statistically significant (P lt 0.05) increases in counts of all types of bacteria were obtained on product samples as a result of processing. Although bacterial counts on neck skin samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.4 log CFU g-1 after spray washing of carcasses, subsequent spinchilling and packaging of whole carcasses resulted in 0.7 to 1.2 log CFU g-1 increases. Bacterial numbers on equipment surfaces, however, decreased significantly from the \"dirty\" to the \"clean\" areas of the abattoir. Transport cages, \"rubber fingers\", defeathering curtains, shackles and conveyor belts repeatedly showed aerobic plate counts in excess of 5.0 log CFU 25 cm-2. Aerobic plate counts of scald tank and spin chiller water were 2 log CFU ml-1 higher than those of potable water samples. Bacterial numbers of the air in the \"dirty\" area were higher than those of the \"clean\" area.

To help generate hypotheses, warehouse store membership card information was collected to identify products consumed by cases. These records identified 19 ill persons who purchased company A salami products before onset of illness. A case-control study was conducted. Ready-to-eat salami consumption was significantly associated with illness (matched odds ratio 8.5, 95% confidence interval 2.1-75.9). The outbreak strain was isolated from company A salami products from an environmental sample from one manufacturing plant, and sealed containers of black and red pepper at the facility.

The present study evaluated Salmonella prevalence and serovar diversity in fruit (225), water (140) and surface (126) samples, from three commercial farms and associated packhouses, located in different farming regions in South Africa. Fruit and water samples were collected from both orchards and packhouses, while surface samples were collected from conveyer belts and hands of packhouse employees. Salmonella was detected in 26 of the 491 (5.3%) samples. Environmental samples (water and surfaces) recorded a slightly higher proportion (3.1%; 15/491) of positive samples compared to fruit samples (2.2%; 11/491). Salmonella was not detected on employee hands and river water samples. A total of 263 Salmonella isolates were obtained from the 26 positive samples by standard culture methods, preliminarily identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) and API 20E, and confirmed by invA gene. Of the 39 representative isolates serotyped the serovars Muenchen (33.3%), Typhimurium (30.8%), Heidelberg (20.5%), Bsilla (7.7%), Salmonella subspecies IIb: 17: r: z (5.1%) and one untypable strain were identified.

Sampling locations were predetermined at the areas where Salmonella contamination may potentially occur, including raw materials receiving, crax (rendered materials before grinding process) grinding, and finished meal loading-out areas. Salmonella was either enumerated directly on xylose lysine Tergitol 4 agar plates or enriched in Rappaport-Vassiliadis and tetrathionate broths. The presumptive Salmonella isolates were confirmed using CHROMagar plating and latex agglutination testing and then characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and biofilm-forming determination. Among 108 samples analyzed, 79 (73%) samples were Salmonella positive after enrichment. Selected Salmonella isolates (n = 65) were assigned to 31 unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, with 16 Salmonella serotypes, including Typhimurium and Mbandaka, identified as predominant serotypes and 10 Salmonella strains determined as strong biofilm formers. Our results indicated that the raw materials receiving area was the primary source of Salmonella and that the surfaces surrounding crax grinding and finished meal loading-out areas harbor Salmonella in biofilms that may recontaminate the finished meals. The same Salmonella serotypes found in both raw materials receiving and the finished meal loading-out areas suggested a potential of cross-contamination between different areas in the rendering processing environment.",

		"abstract": "This study was part of an international research project entitled SALINPORK (FAIR CT-950400) initiated in 1996. The objectives were to investigate the occurrence of Salmonella in pig slaughterhouses and to identify risk factors associated with the contamination of pig carcasses. Data was collected from 12 slaughterhouses in five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom). Isolates were characterized by serotyping, phage typing and antimicrobial susceptibility. In one country, no Salmonella was found. Salmonella was isolated from 5.3% of 3485 samples of pork and from 13.8% of 3573 environmental samples from the seven slaughterhouses in the four remaining countries. The statistical analyses (multi-level logistic regression) indicated that the prevalence was significantly higher during the warmer months and that the environmental contamination increased during the day of slaughter. The polishing (OR 3.74, 95% CI 1.43-9.78) and pluck removal (OR 3.63, 95% CI, 1.66-7.96) processes were found to contribute significantly to the total carcass contamination, the latter especially if the scalding water also was contaminated. To reduce carcass contamination, it is recommended to ensure sufficiently high temperatures of scalding water (62 °C) and appropriate cleaning and disinfection of the polishing equipment at least once a day in order to reduce the level of carcass contamination and consequently the prevalence of Salmonella in pork.",

		"abstract": "Background. In September 1994, the Minnesota Department of Health detected an increase in the number of reports of Salmonella enteritidis infections. After a case-control study implicated a nationally distributed brand of ice cream (Schwan's) in the outbreak, the product was recalled and further epidemiologic and microbiologic investigations were conducted. Methods. We defined an outbreak-associated case of S. enteritidis infection as one in which S. enteritidis was cultured from a person who became ill in September or October 1994. We established national surveillance and surveyed customers of the implicated manufacturer. The steps involved in the manufacture of ice cream associated with cases of S. enteritidis infection were compared with those of products not known to be associated with infection matched for the date of manufacture. Cultures for bacteria were obtained from ice cream samples, the ice cream plant, and tanker trailers that had transported the ice cream base (premix) to the plant. Results. We estimate that S. enteritidis gastroenteritis developed in 224,000 persons in the United States after they ate Schwan's ice cream. The attack rate for consumers was 6.6 percent. Ice cream associated with infection contained a higher percentage of premix that had been transported by tanker trailers that had carried nonpasteurized eggs immediately before (P=0.02). S. enteritidis was isolated from 8 of 266 ice cream products (3 percent), but not from environmental samples obtained from the ice cream plant (n= 157) or tanker trailers (n=204). Conclusions. This nationwide outbreak of salmonellosis was most likely the result of contamination of pasteurized ice cream premix during transport in tanker trailers that had previously carried nonpasteurized liquid eggs containing S. enteritidis. To prevent further outbreaks, food products not destined for repasteurization should be transported in dedicated containers.",

		"abstract": "Salmonella contamination of 71 chicken broiler flocks was investigated at the slaughterhouse in Reunion Island between October 2007 and January 2009. Samples were collected from live broiler chickens and chicken carcasses as well as the slaughterhouse environment. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 40 of 71 (56% with a confidence interval 5% [45-67]) broiler chicken flocks at slaughter. The most prominent serovars were Blockley (31%), Typhimurium and Brancaster (14%), Hadar (10%), Salmonella multidrug resistant clinical organisms serotypes 1,4,[5],12:i:-, and Virchow (8%) and Livingstone, St. Paul, Seftenberg, Llandoff, Infantis and Indiana. At the farm, 27% of the broiler chicken flocks tested positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella spp. was isolated from 124 of 497 environmental samples (25%). In most cases, there was no relationship between pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern and antibiotic resistance pattern. The predominant Salmonella serovars were susceptible to most of the tested antibiotic drugs, but S. Hadar exhibited multidrug resistance. This study highlighted the primary source of Salmonella was the farm of origin and downstream stages in processing could not remedy to but amplify this Salmonella contamination.",

		"abstract": "New consumer tendencies are focused on products derived from systems which allow both a high animal welfare condition and a high food safety level. However, sometimes animal welfare regulations make the adoption of adequate bio-security measures difficult, representing a barrier for animal health and food safety. Thus the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Salmonella at different points of the pig slaughtering process (Trucks, Lairage, Slaughter line and Quartering, TLSQ) from pigs reared in free-range systems. From eight samplings a total of 126 Salmonella isolates out of 1160 different samples were recovered (10.86%). The highest percentage of isolates was detected at the points of pre-scalding (29/80, 36.25%), trucks (13/56, 23.21%), cecal contents (17/80, 21.25%), tonsils (14/80, 17.50%), ileocecal lymph nodes (13/80, 16.25%) and lairage (9/64, 14.06%). Furthermore, eighteen isolates were obtained from different environmental samples from slaughter line and quartering plant (knives and surface of tables) (5.63%) and three isolates at the quartering plant samples (ham, shoulder and loin) (3.75%). Fourteen different serotypes were isolated: Bredeney, Rissen, Derby, Typhimurium, Montevideo, Israel, Anatum, Emek, Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium (mST), Choleraesuis, Durban, Kentucky, London and Sandiego. S. Typhimurium phage types U311, 193, 104b and UT were identified. Moreover, mST strain was phage typed as U311. From TLSQ1, TLSQ2 and TLSQ4, different strains of S. Derby, S. Rissen and S. Bredeney serotypes were isolated from pig and environmental samples, pointing to a potential cross contamination. Molecular typing (Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, PFGE) of these strains confirmed the cross contamination. In the remaining samplings, different serotypes were obtained in each sampled point of the chain, assuming that the isolated serotypes belonged to different epidemiological origins. Our results show the isolation of different serotypes of Salmonella spp. from both pigs and environmental samples, which constitutes a great risk for the contamination of pork from free-range pigs both prior and post slaughter. These data support the intensification of the cleaning and disinfection in the pre-slaughter environment (i.e. trucks, lairage), especially when a higher workload is present, as well as the inclusion of new strategies to decrease or eliminate the risk of Salmonella spp. infection or recontamination from the environment in pork from organic or eco-friendly systems.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is a commonly used tool for epidemiological survey and source tracking of Salmonella strains isolated from various sources. A total of 237 samples from various sources were collected at abattoir and butcheries in Ethiopia from December 2011 to April 2012. Isolates of Salmonella Kastrup (n=3) and Salmonella Larochelle (n=11) were characterized for antimicrobial resistance using disc diffusion and for genotypic profiles using PFGE XbaI. Salmonella Kastrup and S. Larochelle were isolated from 1.3% and 4.6% of total samples (n=237) examined. Except for water samples (n=12) and truck swabs (n=11), all other sample sources were positive for one or more of S. Kastrup and S. Larochelle. Salmonella Kastrup was isolated in Ethiopia for the first time. Salmonella isolates from both Kastrup and Larochelle serotypes showed similar antimicrobial resistance profiles. Two pulsotypes consisting of the same three S. Kastrup and 10 S. Larochelle cluster and second cluster consisting of one S. Larochelle were identified at 1.5% and 1% band positions tolerance by unweighted-pair group method (UPGM) and showed ≥91% similarity. S. Kastrup and S.

Methodology: A survey on Salmonella in two beef production lines (a beef abattoir line and a processing line) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was conducted, with a total of 668 various samples randomly collected from animal-related materials, the environment, and a beef product (mortadella). Results: Overall, a 12.9% prevalence (26.3% from the abattoir line, 5.3% from the processing plant line) was observed. The prevalence in the abattoir line environment (36.6%) was higher than that in animal-related samples (14.7%); the reverse was true for the processing plant line. Out of 86 isolates, 10 serovars were identified, and 8 remained unidentified. The predominant serotypes were S. Saintpaul (32.5%), S. Muenchen (19.8%), and S. Larochelle (12.8%). S. Kastrup and S.

		"abstract": "Degree of microbial contamination in the processing chain of prepacked (bagged) lettuce was studied in 2 Belgian fresh-cut produce processing companies. Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected. Total psychrotrophic aerobic bacterial counts (TPAC) in water samples, fresh produce and environmental samples suggested that the TPAC is not a good indicator of overall quality and best manufacturing practices during production and processing. Because of the high TPAC in harvested lettuces processing water becomes contaminated quickly, and subsequent TPAC do not change much throughout the production process of a batch. The hygiene indicator Escherichia coli was used to assess water management practices in these 2 companies in relation to food safety. Practices such as insufficient cleaning and disinfection of washing baths, irregular refilling of the produce wash baths with water of good microbial quality, and use of high product/water ratios resulted in a rapid increase in E. coli in processing water, with potential transfer to the end product (fresh-cut lettuce). The washing step in the production of fresh-cut lettuce was identified as a potential pathway for dispersion of microorganisms and introduction of E. coli to the end product via cross-contamination. An intervention step to reduce microbial contamination is required, particularly when no sanitizers are used as is the case in some EU countries. Proper water management (and its validation) is a critical point in the fresh-cut produce processing industry.",

		"abstract": "During the winter of 2000-2001, an outbreak due to Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 30 (SE PT30), a rare strain, was detected in Canada. The ensuing investigation, which involved Canadian and American public health and food regulatory agencies and an academic research laboratory, is summarized. Laboratory-based surveillance, including phage typing and PFGE, was used to identify cases, while questionnaires were used to collect information about food and environmental exposures. A case-control study with 16 matched case-control pairs was conducted to test the hypothesis of an association between raw whole almond consumption and infection. Almond samples were collected from case homes, retail outlets and the implicated processor, and environmental samples were collected from processing equipment and associated farms for microbiological testing. 168 confirmed cases of SE PT30 infection (157 in Canada, 11 in the USA) were identified between Oct. 2000 and July 2001. The case-control study identified raw whole almonds as the source of infection (odds ration, 21.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.6 to ). SE PT30 was detected in raw whole natural almonds collected from home, retail, distribution and warehouse sources and from the environmental samples. The frequent, prolonged recovery of this specific organism from a large agricultural area was an unexpected finding and may indicate significant diffuse contamination on these farms. Identification of almonds as the source of a foodborne outbreak is thought to be a previously undocumented finding, leading to a N. American recall of this product and a review of current industry practices.",

Chlorinated water reduced the microbial counts to levels below the lower limit of detection (1.4 log CFU/ml for bacteria and 2.0 log CFU/ml for fungi) in most agricultural water samples. Microbial counts of pesticide solution, which contained the agricultural water or chlorinated water for the mixture, were lower in sanitary field than in control field in both fruit orchards. The number of bacterial and mold species detected in agricultural water, chlorinated water, and pesticide solution were almost proportional to microbial counts in each sample throughout the year. The chlorination treatment of agricultural water tended to reduce the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit during production season. The ethyl alcohol spray treatment on packing shed equipment resulted in a substantial microbial reduction on plastic harvest basket and container in persimmon orchard and plastic harvest basket and container, gloves, scissors, and size sorter in satsuma mandarin orchard. The spray application on packing shed equipment reduced the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit by >1 log CFU/g. The number of satsuma mandarin packing shed equipment containing the species found on fruit peel was higher in control than in sanitary packing shed. No human pathogens such as verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella were detected in any of the fruit and environmental samples. These results indicate that uses of sanitizers such as chlorine for agricultural water and ethyl alcohol for packing shed equipment would be useful in a good agricultural practices program of persimmons and satsuma mandarin.",

We investigated the equipment and environments of the plants and a henhouse (farm A) that supplied shell eggs to plant A, and collected additional liquid eggs and shell eggs from plants A and C. All Salmonella isolates from plant A and the associated farm A, except for a single Typhimurium strain from farm A, were serotyped as Bareilly. Three serovars, including one Bareilly, four Tennessee, and one Richmond, were isolated from plant C. Most Salmonella isolates were susceptible to tested antibiotics. To identify differences between isolates, molecular subtyping by using the automated rep-PCR system was conducted. All Salmonella Bareilly (S. Bareilly) strains from plant A exhibited high similarity, indicating possible contamination by Salmonella strains from the henhouse A. Meanwhile, 2 S. Bareilly strains from plant C, one from liquid egg at the 1st visit and the other from container at the 2nd visit, exhibited identical antibiotic resistance and similar subtyping pattern, but clearly discriminated from the ones of plant A. © 2015 Institute of Food Technologists.",

		"abstract": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that Salmonella on New Zealand eggs is not an important pathway for human salmonellosis. However, robust nationally representative data for Salmonella contamination of eggs is not available to support this. To better understand the exposure of New Zealand commercial eggs to Salmonella, a cross-sectional survey collected data on prevalence and serotypes of Salmonella in the feed, laying sheds (feces, dust, and boot or manure belt swabs), and packhouses (egg contact surfaces) of New Zealand commercial egg layer farms. Salmonella was not detected on 16 of 28 surveyed farms, and 4 farms had only one positive sample. Of the 43 (13.3%) of 323 Salmonella-positive samples, dust samples had the highest prevalence (19 of 67, 28.4%), followed by boot or manure belt swabs (11 of 67, 16.4%), feces (7 of 67, 10.4%), packhouse egg contact surfaces (5 of 87, 5.7%), and feed (1 of 33, 3.0%). A significantly higher prevalence was from caged (33 of 75, 44.0%; P<0.001) compared with cage-free (4 of 126, 3.2%) systems, yet multiple practices differ between laying systems, which could influence prevalence. Salmonella-positive packhouse samples were only identified on the three farms with the highest laying shed prevalence, and isolates were genetically related (as determined by single nucleotide polymorphism analyses) suggesting cross-contamination between the laying shed and packhouse surfaces. Serotypes isolated included Salmonella Infantis, Salmonella Thompson, Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Anatum, and Salmonella Mbandaka. Importantly, Salmonella Enteritidis, which causes egg-associated outbreaks internationally, was not isolated. Genomic comparisons of isolates supported the presence of a common contamination source in the shed and farm environments rather than multiple sporadic contamination events. This survey establishes a benchmark of Salmonella prevalence and types in the New Zealand egg production environment and provides a reference point for assessing the impact of changes to practices on Salmonella prevalence. HIGHLIGHTS Salmonella prevalence was lower than from similar international surveys. The highest prevalence was from pooled dust samples. Salmonella occurred on packhouse egg contact surfaces from high-prevalence farms. Isolates from the same farm, laying shed, and packhouse were genetically related. Isolates included common New Zealand serotypes; Salmonella Enteritidis was not found.",

A total of 77 culture-confirmed Salmonella Newport and 30 Salmonella Reading cases, including 1 case with a double infection, were reported. All strains isolated from the patients were subtyped using serotyping, microbial resistance profiling, and PFGE.

The traceback investigation suggested that the factor connecting the cases was ready-chopped iceberg lettuce available for mass catering use. However, none of the tested food, environmental samples, or the samples taken from the staff of the processing plant contained Salmonella bacteria.

		"abstract": "Stakeholder requirements force companies to analyse their food safety management system (FSMS) performance to improve food safety. Performance is commonly analysed by checking compliance against preset requirements via audits/inspections, or actual food safety (FS) output is analysed by microbiological testing. This paper discusses the usefulness of a concurrent diagnosis of FSMS performance and FS output using new tools; illustrated for three meat-processing companies. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. (food safety indicators), Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae (hygiene indicators), and total viable counts TVC (overall performance) were analysed at ten critical sampling locations covering both product and environmental samples, using the Microbial Assessment Scheme diagnosis. Riskiness of FSMS context and performance of core FSMS activities were assessed using a diagnostic tool (including 51 indicators and corresponding grids with level descriptions). For the (large) beef meat processor, the FS output diagnosis showed too high TVC but the high activity scores of their FSMS indicated that this problem could be only solved by supplier measures. Likewise, for the (medium-size) poultry meat processor, the activity/context diagnosis showed a clear dependency on suppliers. However, the FS output diagnosis revealed a broader contamination problem, and additional measures to improve, amongst others, sanitation program, compliance to procedures, personal hygienic requirements seem necessary. The FS output diagnosis of the (small) lamb meat processor showed various contamination problems (but no pathogens) corresponding with various low activity levels in combination with he high-risk context. The combined diagnosis provided clear directions for improvement to move towards more advanced FSMS activity levels or to reduce riskiness in context. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",

		"abstract": "A systematic approach in monitoring the hygiene of a meat processing plant using classical microbiological analyses combined with molecular characterization tools may assist in the safety of the final products. This study aimed: (i) to evaluate the total hygiene level and, (ii) to monitor and characterize the occurrence and spread of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the environment and the final products of a meat industry that processes meat of global origin. In total, 2541 samples from the processing environment, the raw materials, and the final products were collected from a Greek meat industry in the period 2011-2013. All samples were subjected to enumeration of total viable counts (TVC), Escherichia coli (EC) and total coliforms (TCC) and the detection of Salmonella spp., while 709 of these samples were also analyzed for the presence L. monocytogenes. Pathogen isolates were serotyped and further characterized for their antibiotic resistance and subtyped by PFGE. Raw materials were identified as the primary source of contamination, while improper handling might have also favored the proliferation of the initial microbial load. The occurrence of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes reached 5.5% and 26.9%, respectively. Various (apparent) cross-contamination or persistence trends were deduced based on PFGE analysis results. Salmonella isolates showed wide variation in their innate antibiotic resistance, contrary to L. monocytogenes ones, which were found susceptible to all antibiotics except for cefotaxime. The results emphasize the biodiversity of foodborne pathogens in a meat industry and may be used by meat processors to understand the spread of pathogens in the processing environment, as well as to assist the Food Business Operator (FBO) in establishing effective criteria for selection of raw materials and in improving meat safety and quality. This approach can limit the increase of microbial contamination during the processing steps observed in our study as well as the cross contamination of meat products.",

		"abstract": "To estimate the prevalence and distribution of salmonellae, especially Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), in Western Japan, an investigation was conducted of the chicken industry and environmental sources between 1995 and 1998. Salmonellae were isolated from 34 of 90 samples (37.8%) of raw chicken parts, 34 of 98 faecal samples (34.7%) at 35 broiler farms, 11 of 59 samples (18.6%) of liquid eggs, and from 71 of 272 samples (26.1%) of swab specimens from equipment and cracked or faecally soiled shell eggs at the processing facilities. Salmonellae, including S. Enteritidis, were also isolated from swab samples of hen-houses associated with one of the shell-egg processing facilities (11 samples out of 55, 20%). In the broiler meat production environment, S. Infantis was dominant. Twenty-two of 36 sewage samples (61.1%) and 16 of 72 samples (22.2%) taken from 5 rivers contained salmonellae including S. Enteritidis. S. Enteritidis isolates were analysed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using enzyme Bln I. Thirty-four isolates from shell-egg processing facilities and henhouses, obtained over several years, had the same pulsed-field profile as isolates obtained from four individual outbreaks that occurred in this location in 1997. One of the clonal lines of S. Enteritidis, among multiple serovars of salmonellae in the environment, was thought to have distributed in reservoirs, laying hens, for several years, and continued to cause outbreaks in this area.",

		"abstract": "Introduction: Ice can be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria. This study aimed to identify critical points in iced beverage production and distribution lines to examine the presence of pathogenic bacteria in a beverage and its processing environment, as well as when water and ice used as main ingredients. Methodology: The critical points were determined using the principles of Hazard Analytical Critical Control Point (HACCP) to analyze each processing and distribution step from the survey. Samples collected from the points of concern based on the critical points that were found were tested for pathogens by conventional method and molecular method using primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Escherichia coli was found in 6.34% of samples, and 0.7% of them were confirmed as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by PCR. Vibrio cholerae was found in in 0.7% of water samples used to make iced beverages and in ice production, as well as in 2.12% of distribution and production tools. Salmonella Typhimurium was found in 1.4% of water samples used to make ice and ice products. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 2.02% of the surfaces of ice distribution and production tools and in 5.05% of production and distribution workers' hands. S. aureus counts ranged from 2.4*102-3.5*102 colonies/100 cm2 surface area and 1.9*101-3.7*102 colonies/workers' hands. Conclusion: Control on many critical points in iced beverage processing and distribution is required so that the beverages are safe for consumption.",

		"abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of various Salmonella serotypes in chickens, carcass contact surfaces as well as environmental samples collected from wet markets and small scale processing plant. Materials and Methods: A total of 182 poultry and environmental samples were collected at random on separate occasions from wet markets and small scale processing plant, during the period of October 2014 to July 2015 in Penang and Perlis, Malaysia. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella using ISO 6579:2002 conventional culture-based method. Presumptive Salmonella colonies were subjected to various biochemical tests (such as triple sugar iron and lysine iron test), serologically confirmed using polyvalent O and H antisera and further serotyped at Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Perak, Malaysia. Results: Salmonella serotypes were isolated from 161 out of 182 samples (88.46%) with 100% prevalence in the whole chicken carcass and chicken cuts - as well as transport crate, cage, drum, knife, chopping board, display table, floor, bench wash water, wash water, and drain water. Salmonella was isolated from 91.67%, 83.33%, and 66.67% of defeathering machines, drain swabs, and apron, respectively. 17 serotypes were isolated in this study with Salmonella Albany (57/161), Salmonella Corvallis (42/161), and Salmonella Brancaster (37/161) being the predominant serovars. Conclusion: The most carcass contact and environmental samples collected along the wet market chicken processing line were consistently contaminated with Salmonella. This indicates that Salmonella has established itself in poultry processing environments by colonizing the surfaces of the equipment and survives in these environments by establishing biofilms. Our results highlight the need of implementing strict hygiene and sanitation standards to reduce the incidence of Salmonella. The prevalence of Salmonella in poultry can be reduced effectively by identifying and eliminating the sources and contamination sites during slaughter and processing of poultry.",

A microbial assessment scheme and statistical modeling were used to systematically assess the microbial performance of core control and assurance activities in five Kenyan fresh produce processing and export companies. Generalized linear mixed models and correlated random-effects joint models for multivariate clustered data followed by empirical Bayes estimates enabled the analysis of the probability of contamination across critical sampling locations (CSLs) and factories as a random effect. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in the final products. However, none of the processors attained the maximum safety level for environmental samples. Escherichia coli was detected in five of the six CSLs, including the final product. Among the processing-environment samples, the hand or glove swabs of personnel revealed a higher level of predicted contamination with E. coli, and 80% of the factories were E. coli positive at this CSL. End products showed higher predicted probabilities of having the lowest level of food safety compared with raw materials. The final products were E. coli positive despite the raw materials being E. coli negative for 60% of the processors. There was a higher probability of contamination with coliforms in water at the inlet than in the final rinse water. Four (80%) of the five assessed processors had poor to unacceptable counts of Enterobacteriaceae on processing surfaces.

		"abstract": "Oily, low water activity (OL aw) products including tahini (sesame seed paste), halva (tahini halva), peanut butter, and chocolate, have been recently linked to numerous foodborne illness outbreaks and recalls. This review discusses the ingredients used and processing of OL aw products with a view to provide greater understanding of the routes of their contamination with foodborne pathogens and factors influencing pathogen persistence in these foods. Adequate heat treatment during processing may eliminate bacterial pathogens from OL aw foods; however, post-processing contamination commonly occurs. Once these products are contaminated, their high fat and sugar content can enhance pathogen survival for long periods. The physiological basis and survival mechanisms used by pathogens in these products are comprehensively discussed here. Foodborne outbreaks and recalls linked to OL aw foods are summarized and it was observed that serotypes of Salmonella enterica were the predominant pathogens causing illnesses. Further, intervention strategies available to control foodborne pathogens such as thermal inactivation, use of natural antimicrobials, irradiation and hydrostatic pressure are assessed for their usefulness to achieve pathogen control and enhance the safety of OL aw foods. Sanitation, hygienic design of manufacturing facilities, good hygienic practices, and environmental monitoring of OL aw food industries were also discussed.",

		"abstract": "The effects of existing food safety management systems and size of the production facility on microbiological quality in the dairy industry in Kenya were studied. A microbial assessment scheme was used to evaluate 14 dairies in Nairobi and its environs, and their performance was compared based on their size and on whether they were implementing hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) systems and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22000 recommendations. Environmental samples from critical sampling locations, i.e., workers' hands and food contact surfaces, and from end products were analyzed for microbial quality, including hygiene indicators and pathogens. Microbial safety level profiles (MSLPs) were constructed from the microbiological data to obtain an overview of contamination. The maximum MSLP score for environmental samples was 18 (six microbiological parameters, each with a maximum MSLP score of 3) and that for end products was 15 (five microbiological parameters). Three dairies (two large scale and one medium scale; 21% of total) achieved the maximum MSLP scores of 18 for environmental samples and 15 for the end product. Escherichia coli was detected on food contact surfaces in three dairies, all of which were small scale dairies, and the microorganism was also present in end product samples from two of these dairies, an indication of cross-contamination. Microbial quality was poorest in small scale dairies. Most operations in these dairies were manual, with minimal system documentation. Noncompliance with hygienic practices such as hand washing and cleaning and disinfection procedures, which is common in small dairies, directly affects the microbial quality of the end products. Dairies implementing HACCP systems or ISO 22000 recommendations achieved maximum MSLP scores and hence produced safer products.",

		"abstract": "A salmonellosis outbreak occurred during the summer of 1995 among individuals who consumed nonpasteurized orange juice from a Florida citrus-processing facility. Clinical isolates were identified by the Centers for Disease Control as Salmonella serovars Hartford, Gaminara, and Rubislaw. At the processing facility, 70 samples (equipment swabs, fruit surface swabs, juice, and miscellaneous environmental samples) were collected before, during, and after processing runs on two different dates. Bottled juice samples from eight previous extraction dates were also collected. Total plate counts, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli were enumerated for each sample. Analyses for Salmonella cells were conducted on all juice samples, fruit surface swabs, environmental samples, and selected equipment swabs using direct enrichment and pre-enrichment techniques. Salmonella serovars Hartford, Rubislaw, Saintpaul, and Newport were detected from either juice, unwashed fruit surfaces, or amphibians (Hyla cinerea and Bufo terrestris) captured outside the processing building. Salmonella cells in juice were associated with population levels of fecal coliforms and E. coli above the upper most probable number (MPN) limits of detection (> 110/ml).",

		"abstract": "The aims of the present study were to evaluate the presence of Salmonella in five fermented sausage processing plants and their products during the production process, and to trace the possible sources of contamination. A total of 270 samples were collected: mixture of ground pork meat and fat, products at the end of acidification, sausages at the end of ripening and, during production stages, surfaces in contact with meat and surfaces not in contact with meat. For samples of ground meat, product at the end of acidification and sausages at the end of ripening, the pH and water activity (aw), were determined. All the samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella. Thirtytwo Salmonella isolates were obtained, subjected to serotyping and PFGE. The sausages at the end of ripening pH and aw mean values were 5.390.24 and 0.910.03, respectively. Salmonella was detected in three processing plants with an overall prevalence of 16.7% in food samples and 5.8% in environmental samples. Salmonella prevalence was 24% in ground meat and products at the end of acidification and was also detected in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening (2%). In environmental samples, Salmonella was detected in 6.6% of surfaces in contact with meat and 5% of surfaces not in contact with meat. Five serotypes were identified among 32 isolates: S. Derby (37.5%), S. Typhimurium and S. Rissen (both 25%), S. Give and monophasic S. Typhimurium (both 6.25%). Six different pulsotypes were obtained with PFGE. The serotypes and the PFGE pattern of the strains were specific for each facility with no overlapping between different processing plants. The same observation can be pointed out considering different sampling days for the same processing plants, thus presumably indicating the raw material (ground pork meat and fat) as the source of contamination. The detection of Salmonella in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening highlights the ability of the pathogen to survive during manufacturing process.",

Moreover, aerobic colony count [total viable count (TVC); ISO 4833] and Enterobacteriaceae (ISO 21528-2) of piglets and finishing pigsâ carcasses were evaluated, and the results compared with EU process hygiene criteria (Reg. EC 2073/2005). Salmonella was not isolated in any of the piglets samples. Prevalence differed between slaughterhouses (P<0.5), and Salmonella was isolated from 39 of 244 samples of finishing slaughtered pigs (15.9%) and from 4 of 45 environmental samples (8.9%). In pig samples, carcasses showed the highest prevalence (18%) followed by colon content (14.8%), lymph nodes (13%) and liver (1.6%). S. Anatum was the most prevalent serotype (71.8%), followed by S. Derby (33.3%), S. Bredeney (5%) and S. Holcomb (2.5%). Between environmental samples, S. Anatum (50%), S. Bredeney and S. Derby (25%) were identified. Total viable mean counts (logââ CFU/cmÂ²) of carcass surfaces ranged from 4.6 and 5.7 for piglets, and from 4.6 and 5.9 for finishing pigs, while Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 1.1 and 5 for piglets and between 2.1 and 5.3 for finishing pigs. These results were not in compliance with EU performance criteria. Total aerobic viable counts and Enterobacteriaceae mean levels of environmental samples appeared critical, particularly referred to surfaces in contact with meat (splitting equipment) and indicated an inadequate application of good manufacturing and hygiene practices during slaughtering and sanitisation.",

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Escherichiacoli O157:H7, Listeria spp., L.monocytogenes and Salmonella was determined for cattle hides, carcasses and environmental samples over the course of 5 months at 2 large beef processing plants, A and B, located in the southern and northern United States, respectively. The prevalence of E.coli O157:H7 (68.1 vs. 55.9%) and Salmonella (91.8 vs. 50.3%) was higher (P < 0.05), and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (37.7 vs. 75.5%) and L.monocytogenes (0.8 vs. 18.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the hides of cattle slaughtered at plant A vs. plant B. Similarly, the prevalence of Salmonella (52.0 vs. 25.3%) was higher (P < 0.05) and the prevalence of Listeria spp. (12.0 vs. 40.0%) and L.monocytogenes (1.3 versus 14.7%) was lower (P < 0.05) for the fence panels of the holding pens of plant A vs. plant B. The prevalence of E.coli O157:H7 (3.1 vs. 10.9%), Listeria spp. (4.5 vs. 14.6%), and L.monocytogenes (0.0 vs. 1.1%) was lower (P < 0.05) for pre-evisceration carcasses sampled at plant A vs. plant B. Salmonella (both plants), Listeria spp. (plant B), and L. monocytogenes (plant B) were detected on fabrication floor conveyor belts (product contact surfaces) late during the production day. For plant B, 21 of 148 (14.2%) late-operational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples were L. monocytogenes positive. For plant B, E.coli O157:H7 and L.monocytogenes were detected in pre-operational fabrication floor conveyor belt samples. Overall, results suggest that there are regional differences in the prevalence of pathogens on the hides of cattle processed at commercial beef processing plants. However, it is further suggested that while hide data may reflect the regional prevalence of pathogens, the carcass data is indicative of differences in practices and procedures in these plants.",

		"abstract": "Background: Salmonella is a Gram-negative bacterium and the principal cause of human gastroenteritis that originates from the consumption of animal products. Objective: to determine serotype and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella spp. isolated from pork meat and environmental samples in 6 slaughterhouses and 14 butcheries in Tolima, Colombia. Methods: slaughterhouses and butcheries were selected depending on their slaughter capacity and compliance with good manufacturing practices. Samples (n=507) were taken from carcasses, the environment, and fomites (i.e., surfaces of knives, hooks, floor, siphons, work surfaces, and transport trucks), then cultured in Salmonella selective media. Following this, the isolated Salmonella spp. was identified using a conventional biochemical test and genus antiserum (Poli A+Vi). The Kauffman-Whyte scheme was used for serotyping and the agar diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer) was used to determine antibiotic sensitivity. Results: Manhattan, Derby, Typhimurium, Javiana, Muenster, Hvittingfoss, Sinsfort, Kattbus, and Saint Paul serotypes of Salmonella were isolated from both pork meat and environmental samples, being Derby the most common serotype. Salmonella isolates showed antibiotic multiresistance mainly to tetracycline, lincomycin and nalidixic acid. Conclusions: several Salmonella serotypes are present in slaughterhouses and meat samples from butcheries, and they show similar antibiotic resistance patterns. This work represents the first report on Salmonella serotypes in slaughterhouses and pork meat from butcheries in Tolima, Colombia.",

		"abstract": "An outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Agona infections associated with nationwide distribution of cereal from Company X was identified in April 2008. This outbreak was detected using PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, which coincided with Company X's voluntary recall of unsweetened puffed rice and wheat cereals after routine product sampling yielded Salmonella Agona. A case patient was defined as being infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona, with illness onset from 1 January through 1 July 2008. Case patients were interviewed using a standard questionnaire, and the proportion of ill persons who reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal was compared with Company X's market share data using binomial testing. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture inspected the cereal production facility and collected both product and environmental swab samples. Routine surveillance identified 33 case patients in 17 states. Of 32 patients interviewed, 24 (83%) reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal. Company X puffed rice cereal represented 0.063% of the total ready-to-eat dry cereal market share in the US at the time of the investigation. Binomial testing suggested that the proportion of exposed case patients would not likely occur by chance (P < 0.0001). Of 17 cereal samples collected from case patient homes for laboratory testing, 2 (12%) yielded Salmonella Agona indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. 12 environmental swabs and 9 product samples from the cereal plant yielded the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona. Company X cereal was implicated in a similar outbreak of Salmonella Agona infection in 1998 with the same outbreak strain linked to the same production facility. We hypothesize that a recent construction project at this facility created an open wall near the cereal production area allowing reintroduction of Salmonella Agona into the product, highlighting the resilience of Salmonella in dry food production environments.",

Salmonella was isolated from one or more samples of 47% of the pigs. The highest prevalence of Salmonella was observed in rectal content samples (25.6%), whereas the lowest prevalence of Salmonella was observed on the carcasses (1.4%). The prevalence of Salmonella in other samples was: 19.6% in tonsils, 9.3% on livers, 9.3% on tongues and 9.3% in mesenteric lymph nodes. The prevalence of Salmonella in environmental samples was high in the drain water samples in both slaughterhouses (61%) and on the carcass splitter in one slaughterhouse (33%). S. typhimurium was the most frequently isolated serotype in pig samples and environmental samples in both slaughterhouses: 43% of the Salmonella isolates from pigs and 33% from the environment was S. typhimurium. The results of this study show that Salmonella prevalences in pigs differ a lot, depending on which part of the pig is sampled. Not all different samples of the pig will become available for human consumption, but collecting more than one sample per pig showed that Salmonella can be found in almost the whole pig. The result of surface samples of carcass and liver gives information about hygiene during the slaughter process; the result of tonsils, lymph nodes and rectal contents, combined with the serological result, gives information about infection of the pig before the slaughter process (on the farm, during transport or in lairage). It can be concluded that results of Salmonella isolation of slaughter pigs should always be carefully interpreted, depending on the type of sample that has been collected.",

		"abstract": "Microbial ecosystems were surveyed in 314 environmental samples from 54 Southern and Eastern European small-scale processing units (PUs) manufacturing traditional dry fermented sausages. The residual microflora contaminating the surfaces and the equipment were analysed after cleaning and disinfection procedures. All the PU environments were colonised at various levels by spoilage and technological microflora with excessive contamination levels in some of the PUs. Sporadic contamination by pathogenic microflora was recorded. Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were detected in 4.8% and 6.7% of the samples, respectively, and Staphylococcus aureus was enumerated in 6.1% of the samples. Several critical points were identified, such as the machines for S. aureus and the tables and the knives for L. monocytogenes; this knowledge is crucial for the improvement of hygiene control systems in small and traditional meat processing industries. The variability of the residual contamination emphasized the different cleaning, disinfecting and manufacturing practices routinely followed by these small-scale processing units.

		"abstract": "In order to ascertain the contamination status of Salmonella from carcass, equipment, environment and the intestinal contents in a pig slaughterhouse in Huaian, China, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella isolates in one slaughterhouse. A total of 636 samples were collected; Salmonella was laboratory-confirmed from 154/441 (34.9%) carcass swab-samples, 13/57 (22.8%) pieces of equipment, 30/86 (34.9%) environmental samples and the intestinal contents of 19/52 (36.5%) animals. Salmonella was found to be at its highest and lowest frequency during splitting (55.9%) and flaming (17.2%) processes, respectively. All Salmonella isolates were characterized by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and 69 S. Derby isolates were analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four serovars (S. Derby, S. Rissen, S. Typhimurium, and S. London) were shared from the four sources and predominant serovars were S. Derby and S. Rissen. MLST results indicated that ten different STs were distinguished, of which ST40 was identified as the most prominent ST. Moreover, ST40, ST469, ST34 and ST155 comprised Salmonella isolates obtained from carcass, equipment, the slaughterhouse environment and intestinal contents. PFGE results showed that 33 pulsotypes (PF1-PF33) were identified. PF21, PF25 and PF29 suggested that many isolates from carcass-swab samples at different slaughterhouse process points were of the same pulsotype which also partly comprised isolates from equipment, the environment and intestinal contents. The present study provides an insight into Salmonella distribution in a pig slaughterhouse and revealed that cross-contamination occurs frequently at different sites, which provides data support for proposing some interventions to control Salmonella.",

		"abstract": "The air in 7 Minnesota turkey processing plants was analysed microbiologically for total numbers of bacteria/ft3, number of coliform organisms/ft3, and the presence of salmonellae. Environmental samples (walls, floors, and equipment adjacent to air sampling areas) also were tested for the presence of salmonellae. Areas sampled included: live bird area (hanging, stunning, killing), scald and picking areas, evisceration line, packaging line, and further processing. Total numbers of bacteria in the air of 1 plant ranged from >200 000/ft3 in the live bird area to 1/ft3 near the evisceration line. Coliform numbers in the air of a second plant ranged from 400/ft3 in the live bird area to 0/100 ft3 in the other areas of the plant. Similar results were obtained in the other plants. Salmonellae were found in the air of the live bird area in 6 of the 7 plants and in the picking room of the other one. In each of the 7 plants salmonellae were not recovered from the air in other processing areas. The data indicate that salmonellae are frequently found in the air where live birds are handled but are difficult to isolate or find in other areas of the plant.",

		"abstract": "The first book devoted to an increasingly critical public health issue, Control of Salmonella and Other Bacterial Pathogens in Low-Moisture Foods reviews the current state of the science on the prevalence and persistence of bacterial pathogens in low-moisture foods and describes proven techniques for preventing food contamination for manufacturers who produce those foods. Many pathogens, such as Salmonella, due to their enhanced thermal resistance in dry environments, can survive the drying process and may persist for prolonged periods in low-moisture foods, especially when stored in refrigerated environments. Bacterial contamination of low-moisture foods, such as peanut butter, present a vexing challenge to food safety, and especially now, in the wake of widely publicized food safety related events, food processors urgently need up-to-date, practical information on proven measures for containing the risk of contamination. While much has been written on the subject, until now it was scattered throughout the world literature in scientific and industry journals. The need for a comprehensive treatment of the subject has never been greater, and now this book satisfies that need. Discusses a wide variety of foods and evaluates multiple processing platforms from the standpoint of process validation of all food safety objectives for finished food products * Takes a practical approach integrating the latest scientific and technological advances in a handy working resource * Presents all known sources and risk factors for pathogenic bacteria of concern in the manufacturing environment for low-moisture/water activity products * Characterizes the persistence and thermal resistance of bacterial pathogens in both the environment and most low-moisture food products * Control of Salmonella and Other Bacterial Pathogens in Low-Moisture Foods is a much-needed resource for food microbiologists and food industry scientists, as well as managers and executives in companies that produce and use low-moisture foods. It also belongs on the reference shelves of food safety regulatory agencies worldwide.",
